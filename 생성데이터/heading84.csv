(I) 원자로
원자로(nuclear reactor)란 일반적으로 생물보호용 방사선 차폐물(shield) 그 자체(해당사항이 있는 경우)와 그 차폐물에 의하여 차단된 구역 내의 모든 장치와 기기를 포함한다. 또한 차폐물(screen)의 내측에 포함되어 있는 장치와 기기와 일체를 이루고 있는 것이면 차폐된 구역 밖에 있는 다른 장치와 기기도 포함한다.
원자로는 일반적으로 다음 물품으로 구성된다.
(A) 노심부(爐心部 : core)(다음의 부분으로 이루어진다) :
(1) 핵연료[핵분열성(fissile)이나 핵연료성(fertile)의 것]. 감속재(moderator) 중에 용해나 분산되어 있거나(균질형 원자로) 연료 요소[카트리지(cartridge)] 중에 농축되어 있다(비균질형 원자로).
(2) 감속재(moderator)와 해당사항이 있는 경우 중성자 반사체[예: 베릴륨(beryllium)ㆍ흑연ㆍ물ㆍ중수(heavy water)ㆍ디페닐(diphenyl)이나 터페닐(terphenyl)과 같은 특정의 탄화수소]
(3) 냉각체(coolant). 이것은 원자로에서 발생되는 열을 제거하는 역할을 한다[이산화탄소ㆍ헬륨ㆍ중수(heavy water)ㆍ용융(鎔融 : molten)나트륨이나 용융(鎔融)비스무트ㆍ용융(鎔融)한 나트륨과 칼륨의 혼합물ㆍ용융(鎔融)염ㆍ특정의 탄화수소 등이 흔히 이 목적으로 사용한다]. 그러나 감속재(moderator)가 흔히 냉각체로도 작용된다.
(4) 제어봉(制御棒 : control rod) : 중성자(neutron)를 흡수하는 능력을 두드러지게 갖고 있는 물질의 것(예: 붕소ㆍ카드뮴ㆍ하프늄)이나 이러한 물질의 합금으로 만든 것이나 화합물로 만든 것이 있다.
(B) 기계적 구조물[예: 원자로 용기 ; 핵연료 요소(카트리지) 로딩용 격자 ; 냉각체의 이송용 배관 ; 밸브 ; 제어봉의 조작기구 등]
(C) 측정용ㆍ검사용이나 자동 제어용의 기기[예: 중성자원(中性子源 : neutron source)ㆍ전리함ㆍ열전대(thermocouple)ㆍ망원사진기ㆍ압력계나 유량계]
(D) 열 차폐물(shields)이나 생물학적인 차폐물[강(鋼)ㆍ콘크리트나 납으로 만든 것 등]
어떤 경우에는 다른 종류의 장치와 기기가 또한 원자로 설비에 사용하기도 하며, 생물보호용 방사선 차폐물(shield)에 의하여 차단되는 구역 내에 설치되는 경우도 있다. 이러한 것은 원자로의 부분품으로서 본질적인 특성을 갖는 것으로 간주하지 않으므로 각 해당하는 호로 분류해야 한다[아래 제외규정 (c)에서 (ij)까지를 참조할 것].
다만, 원자로의 구성 부분품의 성질ㆍ특징과 조립 방식은 상당한 차이가 있을 수 있다. 즉, 원자로의 다양한 형태는 일반적으로 다음의 관점에 의하여 구별된다.
(1) 연쇄반응(chain reaction)을 증식시키는 중성자의 에너지[예: 열(저속)로ㆍ중속로와 고속로]
(2) 원자로의 노심부(爐心部 : core) 안에서 핵분열성(fissile) 물질의 배분(예: 균질형 원자로와 비균질형 원자로)
(3) 사용목적[예: 연구용 로ㆍ동위원소생산용 로ㆍ재료시험용 로ㆍ핵분열연료 물질을 핵분열성 물질로 전환하는 노(爐)(전환로와 증식로)ㆍ추진용 로ㆍ열에너지나 전기에너지의 발생로 등]
(4) 사용재료의 종류와 작동의 원리[예: 천연우라늄ㆍ농축우라늄ㆍ우라늄-토륨ㆍ나트륨-흑연ㆍ기체흑연ㆍ가압수ㆍ가압중수ㆍ비등수(boiling water)ㆍ스위밍 풀(swimming pool)ㆍ유기감속기 형식의 노(爐)]
일반적으로 원자로의 크기는 최소한 “임계(臨界 : critical)”현상이 되도록 설계되어 있으므로, 중성자의 외부손실로 인하여 연쇄반응이 중단되는 일은 결코 없다. 그러나 연구목적으로는 중성자원의 추가를 요하는 “아임계(亞臨界) 원자로(subcritical reactor)”가 가끔 사용하기도 한다. 이들 노(爐)도 또한 이 호에 포함한다.
원자로의 부분품이 분리하여 제시하는 경우에는 일반적으로 제16부의 주 제2호의 규정에 따라 분류한다.
제어봉(control rod)과 제어봉 작동기구로의 핵분열반응을 촉발시키기 위하여 부착한 중성자원ㆍ용기ㆍ핵연료 요소(카트리지)의 삽입용 격자(grid)와 가압 경수로(輕水爐 : water reactor)의 가압기(pressuriser)는 원자로의 부분품으로서 이 호에 분류한다.
다만, 다음의 물품은 원자로 부분품으로 간주하지 않는다.

(b) 금속의 관(metal tube and pipe)(특수 형태로 되어 있거나, 그 밖의 다른 방법으로 가공하지 않고 단지 성형만 한 것으로 조립되지 않은 상태로 제시한 것. 그러나 원자로의 건설용으로 인정될 수 있는 것인지에는 상관없다)(제15부)
(c) 증기 보일러와 그 밖의 증기발생 보일러(제8402호)
(d) 열교환기(제8404호나 제8419호)
(e) 증기터빈과 그 밖의 증기터빈(제8406호)
(f) 펌프(제8413호나 제8414호)
(g) 송풍기(제8414호)
(h) 물에서 광물성 물질을 추출하는 장치(일반적으로 제8419호나 제8421호)
(ij) 연료 요소(fuel element)의 위치변경이나 추출용의 취급기기와 운반크레인(일반적으로 제8426호)
(k) 방사성물품의 기계식 원격조정기(제8428호)
(II) 방사성 동위원소분리용 기기
이들 그룹은 동위원소 중의 하나의 원소를 화학적 원소나 화합물로 농축하거나 혼합 구성된 동위원소를 완전 분리하는데 사용하도록 제작된 모든 기계적ㆍ열관계적ㆍ전기적 기기를 포함한다.
가장 중요한 것은 중수(산화중수소)의 생산용이나 우라늄을 U235로 농축하는데 사용하는 기기들이다.
천연의 물을 농축하여 중수를 생산하는 기기들에는 다음과 같은 것을 포함한다.
(1) 특수한 분별 분류(fractional distillation) 장치와 정류(精溜) 기기 : 클러스터(cluster)모양과 캐스케이드(cascade)모양의 정돈된 수많은 판으로 구성되고 중수와 표준수 간의 끓는점에 관한 아주 적은 차이점을 이용하는 기기이다[이것은 중수를 연속적으로 더욱더 감소시키는 초기분획물(head fraction)과 연속적으로 더욱 더 농축시키는 최종분획물(tail fraction)을 얻기 위한 것이다].
(2) 액체수소의 저온 분류(分溜 : fractional distillation)에 의하여 중수소를 별도 분리하고 중수를 얻기 위하여 연소시킬 수 있는 기기
(3) 동위원소 교환원리를 이용한(때로는 촉매제 존재 하에서) 중수나 중수소 화합물의 생산용 기기 : 예를 들면, 이중온도 방법에 의한 것이나 서로 다른 액체 상태나 가스 상태 수소의 접촉에 의한 것을 들 수 있다.
(4) 물의 전기분해에 의하여 중수를 만들어 내는데 사용하는 전해전지와 생성된 수소와 생성되는 물 그 자체 사이의 동위원소교환과 함께 전기분해를 연결하는 기기
U235로 우라늄을 농축하는 데는 다음 기기가 주로 자주 사용한다.
(1) “가스(gas)”(6플루오르화 우라늄)원심분리기라 부르는 특수 원심분리기 : 이것은 플라스틱으로 만든 것이나 철강으로 만든 원통형의 로터(rotor)(“사발(bowl)”)를 가지고 있으며 매우 빠른 속도로 회전한다.
이들 원심분리기는 안쪽에 6플루오르화 우라늄에 의한 부식을 막도록 처리되어 있다. 실제에 있어서는, 수많은 유닛(unit)을 사용하며 캐스케이드(cascade) 모양으로 배열되어 있고 하강이나 역류 작동하는데 사용한다.

전자적 질량 분리식 방식의 동위원소 분리장치도 또한 이 호에 분류한다.
부분품의 분류에 관한 일반 규정에 의하여(제16부 총설 참조), 이 그룹의 기기 부분품도 역시 이 호에 포함한다.
(III) 방사선을 조사(照射 : irradiate)하지 않은 원자로용 연료 요소[카트리지(cartridge)]
방사선을 조사(照射 : irradiate)하지 않은 원자료용 연료 요소[카트리지(catridge)]는 일반적으로 비금속(卑金屬 : base metal)으로 만든(예: 지르코늄ㆍ알루미늄ㆍ마그네슘ㆍ스테인리스강으로 만든 것) 쉬이드(sheath) 안에 포함된 핵분열성(fissile)이나 핵연료성(fertile) 물질로 되어 있으며, 취급상 특수 부착물을 부착해 놓은 것이다.
핵분열성 연료 요소(fissile fuel element)는 금속이나 화합물(산화물ㆍ탄화물ㆍ질화물 등)형태의 천연우라늄, 금속상태나 화합물로서의 우라늄-235, 우라늄-233이나 플루토늄으로 농축된 우라늄, 플루토늄으로 농축된 토륨을 함유한다. 연료핵친원소(예: 토륨이나 감손 우라늄)를 중성자가 반사되도록 노(爐 : furnace) 주위에 갖다 놓으면 중성자가 약간 흡수된 후 핵분열성 물질이 된다.
원자로용 연료 요소는 여러 가지 형태가 있는데 예를 들면, 다음과 같다.
(1) 가연성(可燃性)의 금속이나 합금으로서 비금속(卑金屬 : base metal)으로 피복된(被覆 : sheathed) 봉(bar)이나 관(管 : tube) 형태의 것. 이러한 금속으로 만든 피복관에는 열 교환이 용이하도록 플랜지(flange)가 붙어 있으며, 핵연료요소는 원자로에 삽입이나 인출이 편리하도록 지지물과 헤드(head)가 갖추어져 있을 수도 있다.
(2) 흑연으로 쌓은 봉ㆍ판이나 구(球) 모양의 흑연으로 만든 핵분열연료 분산제나 분산제와 서멧(cermet)의 그 밖의 형태로 구성되는 핵분열연료 분산제. 이들은 위의 (1)에 설명된 핵연료요소[카트리지(cartridge)]와 똑같은 방법으로 플랜지(flange)를 붙였거나 부착물을 붙였다.
(3) 조립품으로서 다음의 것이 있다.
(i) 불활성(inert)의 금속으로 외측이 피복(被覆 : coated)된 핵분열성이나 연료핵친원소[금속이나 세라믹콤파운드(ceramic compound)]로 구성되는 일종의 샌드위치판

또는
(iii) 불활성(inert)금속으로 피복(被覆 : sheathed)된 농축한 핵분열성 금속 관(tube)
이들 모든 모양의 핵연료 요소[카트리지(cartridge)]는 적당한 위치로 간격을 띄어서 맞게 하는 지지물이 고정되어 있으며 ; 이러한 것은 때때로 외부 케이싱을 갖고 있다. 이와 같은 핵 연료 요소를 구성하는 모든 보조 요소(sub-element)는 동일 베이스에 장착되어 있거나 동일 헤드에 부착되어 있다.
이들 보조 요소(sub-element)[예: 핵연료로 충전되었거나 봉함된 스테인리스 스틸 쉬이드(stainless steel sheath)]가 따로 분리되어 제시될 경우 이들은 핵연료 요소[카트리지(cartridge)]의 부분품으로 분류한다.
구(球) 모양이나 프리즘 모양(角柱狀 : prismatic)의 핵연료요소에 사용할 목적으로 탄소나 탄화규소의 층으로 피복된 핵연료 마이크로스피어(microsphere)와 이미 사용한[방사선을 조사(照射)한] 핵연료 요소[카트리지(cartridge)]는 제2844호에 분류한다.

- Steam or other vapour generating boilers :
8402.11 - Watertube boilers with a steam production exceeding 45 t per hour
8402.12 - Watertube boilers with a steam production not exceeding 45 t per hour
8402.19 - Other vapour generating boilers, including hybrid boilers
8402.20 - Super-heated water boilers
8402.90 - Parts
(A) STEAM OR OTHER VAPOUR GENERATING BOILERS
This group includes apparatus for generating steam or other vapour (e.g., mercury vapour) to operate prime movers (e.g., steam turbines) or other machines using steam power (e.g., steam hammers and pumps) or to supply steam to apparatus for heating, cooking, sterilising, etc., including steam generating boilers for central heating.
It includes separately presented boilers (e.g., locomotive boilers) even though they may clearly be specially constructed to form an integral part of a particular machine, apparatus or vehicle.
Steam boilers may be heated by means of a solid, liquid or gaseous fuel, or by electricity.
The desire to obtain a more efficient heating effect, or quicker vaporisation from fuel-burning boilers has led to the production of boilers differing in structure. The main types are :
(1) Firetube boilers (e.g., locomotive boilers), in which the body of the boiler is traversed by tubes through which the flue gases are conducted.
(2) Watertube boilers, in which a system of watertubes is surrounded by the flue gases; the internal walls of some boilers are also formed of watertubes.
(3) Hybrid boilers, which are generally a combination of types (1) and (2) above.
In some boilers, the systems of tubes are connected by a collector to one or more generally cylindrical bodies which serve to store the water or separate the water from the vapour. In others, known as forced circulation boilers, there is sometimes no evaporation drum and the circulation of the water is accelerated by a pump.
Boilers vary considerably in size. Small boilers are usually presented assembled, the various components being enclosed in a shell or mounted on a common base. The larger boilers comprise as a rule a number of separate elements for assembly on site, either within a shell or within a structure of brickwork.
(B) SUPER-HEATED WATER BOILERS
These are boilers in which the water is submitted to fairly high pressure so that it can be heated to a temperature far in excess of the normal vaporisation point (generally of the order of 180 C or more).
These boilers are structurally very similar to the boilers described in Part (A) above. The pressure required for their operation is obtained either by accumulating steam in, for example, an evaporator drum, or in some cases, by means of an inert gas (generally nitrogen). The super-heated water produced in the boiler must be kept constantly under pressure. It therefore circulates in closed circuit, starting from and returning to the boiler.
Super-heated water boilers are used to provide heat, generally at a distance, to industrial plant (motor vehicle body paint drying tunnels, for instance), or to large groups of buildings or district heating schemes. In the latter case, heat is provided through heat exchangers in which the super-heated water (primary fluid) transfers calories to a secondary fluid that heats the premises.
In order to increase or regulate their output or efficiency, the boilers of this heading are often equipped with a wide range of auxiliary apparatus. Such auxiliary apparatus includes economisers, air pre-heaters, super-heaters, de-super-heaters, steam receivers, steam accumulators, soot removers, gas recoverers, watertube fire-box walls and other apparatus of heading 84.04, and feed water purifiers, de-aerators, de-gasifiers and softeners of heading 84.21.
Such auxiliaries are classified with the boilers in this heading when they are presented together therewith, whether they already form, or are designed to form subsequently, a whole with those boilers; if presented separately they are to be classified in their own appropriate headings.
Similarly, and provided they are designed to form a whole therewith, grates presented with boilers are classified in this heading together with the boiler. In this respect, no distinction is made between grates already incorporated in boilers and those designed to be combined with boilers by means of a brickwork structure.
The heading excludes the types of boilers designed only for heating water to a temperature below its normal vaporisation point, and central heating hot water boilers of heading 84.03 (even if capable also of producing low pressure steam).
PARTS
Subject to the general provisions regarding the classification of parts (see the General Explanatory Note to Section XVI), parts of the boilers of this heading are also covered, e.g., boiler bodies and bases, internal assemblies for boilers consisting of tubes, watertube caps, headers, boiler drums, steam domes, non-mechanical fire-boxes, inspection covers and fusible plugs.
Metal tubes or pipes which have been bent or curved but not otherwise worked, presented unassembled, are not identifiable as parts of boilers and are therefore to be classified in Section XV."
2,8403,"84.03 - Central heating boilers other than those of heading 84.02.
8403.10 - Boilers
8403.90 - Parts
This heading includes central heating boilers of any size (other than stoves with subsidiary boilers, of heading 73.21), using any type of fuel (e.g., wood, coal, coke, gas, fuel oil), for heating houses, flats, factories, workshops, greenhouses, etc., by circulation of water; it also includes electric central heating boilers.
They may be equipped with pressure regulators and gauges, water levels, taps, cocks, burners and similar parts or accessories.
Hot water boilers, even if also capable of producing low pressure steam, are also classified in this heading.
PARTS
Subject to the general provisions regarding the classification of parts (see the General Explanatory Note to Section XVI), this heading also covers identifiable parts of central heating boilers such as boiler casings, walls, doors and manhole or inspection port covers, etc.
The following are not regarded as parts :
(a) Pipes and fittings to connect up central heating boilers and radiators (generally headings 73.03 to 73.07).
(b) Expansion reservoirs or chambers (heading 73.09, 73.10 or 84.79).

8404.90 - Parts
(A) AUXILIARY PLANT FOR USE WITH BOILERS
OF HEADING 84.02 OR 84.03
These include :
(1) Economisers for pre-heating the boiler feed water by utilising the waste heat of the flue gases or, in some types, exhaust steam. They usually consist of headers fitted with a system of cast iron or steel gilled tubing, sometimes contained within a separate chamber of sheet metal into which the flue gases or exhaust steam are discharged. In the mixing type economiser waste steam is passed directly into a chamber containing the feed water.
(2) Air pre-heaters. These also make use of the waste heat. They consist of air chambers with heat-exchange systems of varying types, e.g., tubular types through which the hot flue gases circulate thus heating the air in the chamber; plate-type in which air and smoke gases circulate separately in adjoining narrow compartments. Certain types incorporate rotating baffle plates.
(3) Super-heaters. These consist of headers with a high-pressure steel tube system in which the saturated steam from the boiler is further heated to remove moisture and to produce steam at high temperature. Super-heaters are often part of the main boiler assembly, but in some cases have a separate flue system.
(4) De-super-heaters. These are used to prevent the development of too high a temperature in the super-heaters. Normally they are placed between two sections of the super-heater, and generally consist of a cast iron body into which the steam is passed and cooled by a flow of water.
(5) Steam collectors. Cylindrical bodies for collecting the steam from a group of boilers.
(6) Steam accumulators. Large insulated cylindrical steel high-pressure reservoirs for the storage of a reserve of steam.
(7) Thermic or heat accumulators. These are used to store the surplus heat from steam boilers.
(8) Tubular furnace-walls, i.e., a system of vertical tubing connected to conduits in which the feed water circulates, and designed to be mounted in front of the interior surface of the furnace walls. They serve the double function of preventing the over-heating of the furnace walls and at the same time pre-heating the feed water.
(9) Soot removers (soot blowers), automatic or not. These remove soot and similar deposits from the tubular parts of the steam-generating installation (e.g., super-heaters, watertubes, firetubes and economisers) by the use of jets of steam or compressed air. They consist of a tube (fixed or retractable) with a number of jets controlled by a valve and coupled to the steam or compressed air conduit. In other cases soot removers take the form of retractable jets.
(10) Gas recoverers. These are devices by which the exhaust gases are returned to the furnace for combustion of unburnt particles.
(11) Sludge scrapers.
(B) CONDENSERS
FOR STEAM OR OTHER VAPOUR POWER UNITS
These include steam condensers of various kinds, whose function is to reduce the back pressure in steam engines by cooling and condensing the exhaust steam, thus increasing the power of the engine. They include :
(1) Surface-condensers. These consist of a cylindrical shell enclosing a system of tubes. The steam is led into the cylinder, and cold water circulates through the pipes (or occasionally vice versa) thus condensing the steam.
(2) Mixing condensers. In these the steam is mixed directly with water. The heading includes ejector condensers in which a partial vacuum is created in the condenser chamber by a jet of water (acting in the same way as the jet in an ejector pump).
(3) Air-cooled condensers. These consist of gilled steam tubing cooled by a forced current of air.
PARTS
Subject to the general provisions regarding the classification of parts (see the General Explanatory Note to Section XVI), the heading also covers parts of the above apparatus and appliances.
Metal tubes or pipes which have been bent or curved but not otherwise worked, presented unassembled, are not identifiable as parts of goods of this heading and are therefore to be classified in Section XV.
The heading excludes the following, whether or not for use in boiler-houses :
(a) Pumps (including water-injectors for force-feeding the boiler), blowers, fans and other machinery of heading 84.13 or 84.14.
(b) Furnace burners, mechanical grates, mechanical stokers and the like (heading 84.16).
(c) Distillation and other condensers of heading 84.19.
(d) Filters and purifiers for water, gases, etc. (heading 84.21)."
4,8405,"84.05 - 발생로가스(producer gas)나 수성(水性)가스 발생기, 아세틸렌가스 발생기와 이와 유사한 습식가스 발생기(청정기를 갖춘 것인지에 상관없다)
8405.10 - 발생로가스(producer gas)나 수성(水性)가스 발생기, 아세틸렌가스 발생기와 이와 유사한 습식가스 발생기(청정기를 갖춘 것인지에 상관없다)
8405.90 - 부분품
이 호에는 모든 가스[예: 발생로가스(producer gas)ㆍ수성(水性)가스(water gas)와 이들의 혼합가스나 아세틸렌가스 등]의 일체식 발생장치가 포함되며 발생되는 가스의 용도에는 상관없다. 다만, 그 용도를 예를 들면, 조명용ㆍ공업적 가열용ㆍ가스엔진의 공급용ㆍ금속의 용접용과 절단용ㆍ화학합성용 등이 있다.
이 호에는 자동차용으로 특별히 제작된 발생로가스(producer gas) 발생기가 포함되나 실제로는 램프에 불과하며 버너만을 부착하게 되어 있는 아세틸렌가스 발생기(제9405호)는 제외한다.
(A) 발생로가스(producer gas) 발생기
이 발생기(generator)는 일반적으로 불판(고정식ㆍ진동식이나 회전식)가 들어 있는 내화성의 내장이 되었거나 수냉식으로 된 이중벽과 흡인이나 송풍에 의하여 공기(또는 공기와 증기)의 흐름을 통과시키는 장치를 갖춘 밀폐식의 실린더(cylinder)로 구성되어 있다. 두꺼운 연료층은 불판 위에서 연소되고 공기와 증기의 유량은 연소가 불완전하도록 조절된다. 물의 분해 작용과 연료의 불완전 연소로 인하여 일산화탄소와 수소가 발생한다. 그 결과로 생긴 일산화탄소ㆍ수소와 질소[발생로가스(producer gas)]의 혼합 가스는 이 장치의 상부에서 제거된다.
“반전(反轉)연소식(reversed combustion)”의 발생기에 있어서는 공기는 상부로부터 실린더(cylinder)의 측면벽을 통하여 하부에 송풍되고, 가스는 불판의 하부에 있는 장치의 밑바닥에 모여져 타르 등의 보다 완전한 연소를 돕는다.
(B) 수성(水性)가스(water gas) 발생기
발생로가스 발생기와 유사하나 공기와 물이나 증기를 장치 내에 번갈아 불어 넣도록 제작되어 있다. 물을 불어 넣었을 때 발생하는 가스는 발생로가스(producer gas)보다 훨씬 높은 열량을 갖는 수소와 일산화탄소의 혼합가스[수성(水性)가스]이다. 이 가스는 공기를 불어 넣었을 때 얻는 발생로가스로부터 분리되어 수집되거나 그러한 두 가지의 가스가 혼합된다.
*

This heading covers steam turbines which are driven by the kinetic energy of expanding steam applied to the vanes or blades of a wheel. They consist essentially of :
(1) A rotor comprising a shaft on which is mounted a wheel (or wheels) the rim of which carries a row of closely-spaced vanes or blades generally of curved cross-section and sometimes referred to as “buckets”.
(2) A stator consisting of a casing, in which the rotor is supported and revolves, containing a system of stationary blades or nozzles to direct the steam on to the blading of the rotor.
In “impulse” turbines the stator is provided with nozzles in which the steam expands and issues at high velocity tangentially to the bucket blades of the rotor. In a “reaction” turbine the blades on the rotor revolve between similarly shaped stationary blades mounted in the reverse form round the face of the stator, and so arranged that the steam flows axially through the blades of the stator and on to the adjacent blades of the rotor.
For greater efficiency two systems are often combined in “compound turbines”, but more often a series of rotors are mounted on a common shaft (multi-stage turbines) to allow progressive expansion of the steam.
The high rotational speed of turbines makes them particularly suitable for the direct driving of machines such as electric generators (turbo-generators), compressors, ventilators or centrifugal pumps. For some purposes (e.g., steamships and certain locomotives) turbines are fitted with reversing or reduction gear. When presented separately, these reversing or reduction gears are excluded (heading 84.83).
This heading also covers mercury vapour turbines. These are of a structure and use similar to the steam turbines described above, but use mercury vapour in place of steam.
PARTS
An essential component of a turbine is a governing mechanism so that the supply of steam or other vapour to the turbine can be adjusted to suit the load and to maintain constant speed.
This heading covers such governors and, subject to the general provisions regarding the classification of parts (see the General Explanatory Note to Section XVI), other parts of turbines (e.g., rotors and stators and their segments, rotor or stator blades)."

8407.34 - Of a cylinder capacity exceeding 1,000 cc
8407.90 - Other engines
This heading covers spark-ignition reciprocating internal combustion piston engines and rotary internal combustion piston engines (Wankel engines having a trilobal disc type “piston”), other than those of Chapter 95. It includes such engines for motor vehicles.
These engines generally have the following elements : cylinder, piston, connecting-rod, crank shaft, flywheel, inlet and exhaust valves, etc. They make use of the expansion force of a charge of inflammable gas or vapour burned inside a cylinder.
The characteristic feature of these engines is that they are equipped with sparking plugs fitted into the cylinder head and with electrical devices (such as magnetos, coils and contact breakers) synchronised with the motor, for supplying high tension current.
In the more common types the fuel and air are mixed (e.g., in a carburettor) before induction into the cylinder by the suction stroke of the piston, but in some cases (e.g., certain aircraft engines and motor car engines) the fuel is introduced into the cylinder head directly by an injector.
The most usual fuel is petrol, but others include kerosene, alcohol, hydrogen, coal gas, methane, etc.
Gas engines are most frequently fed by producer gas generators which are sometimes integral with the engine, but are more often independent. In the latter case the generators are always classified in heading 84.05.
These engines may have one or several cylinders. In the latter case the connecting-rods are coupled to a single crank shaft, and the cylinders, fed separately, may be arranged in various ways, e.g., in a vertical line (upright or inverted), in two symmetrical obliquely opposed rows (V-engines), horizontally opposed on opposite sides on the crank shaft or, for certain aircraft engines, radially. The rotary piston engine (Wankel engine) operates on the same general principle as the conventional piston engines described above. However, instead of a crank shaft turned by an oscillating piston and connecting rod, the rotary piston engine has a trilobal disc (“piston”) in a specially shaped housing (epitrochoid), which directly rotates a driving shaft.
The “piston” divides the housing (combustion chamber) into several compartments and each complete rotation corresponds for each lobe to a four-stroke cycle. These engines may have one or more housings with “pistons”.
The engines of this heading are suitable for very many uses, e.g., in agricultural machines; for driving electric generators, pumps or compressors; for propelling aircraft, motorcars, motorcycles, autocycles, tractors or boats.
The engines of this heading may be equipped with fuel injection pumps, ignition parts, fuel or oil reservoirs, water radiators, oil coolers, water, oil or fuel pumps, blowers, air or oil filters, clutches or power drives, or starting devices (electric or other). Change speed gears may also be fitted. The engines may also be equipped with a flexible shaft.
The heading includes “outboard motors” for the propulsion of small boats, consisting of a motor of this heading, a propeller and a steering device, the whole constituting a single, indivisible unit. These motors, designed to be attached to the outside of the hull of the boat, are detachable, that is they can be attached and removed easily and are adjustable, the unit turning on the point of attachment. However, motors designed to be fixed to the inside of the hull at the rear of the boat combined with a block holding a steering propeller fixed to the exterior of the boat at the corresponding place are not regarded as outboard motors.
It also covers mobile motors consisting of engines mounted on a wheeled chassis or on runners, including those with driving mechanisms permitting their self-propulsion to a certain extent (but not constituting vehicles of Chapter 87).
The heading excludes variable compression motors of the spark-ignition internal combustion piston engine type designed specially for determination of the octane and cetane value of motor fuels (Chapter 90).

8408.90 - Other engines
This heading covers compression-ignition internal combustion piston engines (other than those of Chapter 95), including those for motor vehicles.
These engines are of similar mechanical construction to spark-ignition internal combustion piston engines and have the same essential elements (i.e., cylinder, piston, connecting-rod, crank shaft, flywheel, inlet and exhaust valves, etc.), but differ in that the air (or sometimes air mixed with gas) is first admitted to the cylinder where it is rapidly compressed. Atomised liquid fuel is then injected into the combustion chamber where it is spontaneously ignited by the heat developed, the compression being considerably greater than in the spark-ignition engine.
In addition to diesel engines, there are intermediate compression-ignition semi-diesel engines which operate at lower compression. To start this type, the cylinder-head must be pre-heated by a blow-lamp or a glow plug must be used.
Compression-ignition internal combustion piston engines operate on heavy fluid fuels such as heavy petroleum or coal tar oils, shale oils, vegetable oils (ground-nut, castor, palm, etc.).
The engines of this heading may have one or several cylinders. In the latter case the connecting-rods are coupled to a single crank shaft, and the cylinders, fed separately, may be arranged in various ways, e.g., in a vertical line (upright or inverted), in two symmetrical obliquely opposed rows (V-engines), horizontally opposed on opposite sides on the crank shaft.
The engines of this heading are suitable for very many uses, e.g., in agricultural machines, for propelling motorcars, tractors, locomotives or ships or in electric power stations, etc.
The engines of this heading may be equipped with fuel injection pumps, ignition parts, fuel or oil reservoirs, water radiators, oil coolers, water or oil pumps, blowers, air or oil filters, clutches or power drives, or starting devices (electric or other). Change speed gears may also be fitted. The engines may also be equipped with a flexible shaft.
It also covers mobile motors consisting of engines mounted on a wheeled chassis or on runners, including those with driving mechanisms permitting their self-propulsion to a certain extent (but not constituting vehicles of Chapter 87).

8410.90 - Parts, including regulators
This heading covers hydraulic turbines and water wheels which can, by themselves, transform into motive power the energy possessed by moving liquids or liquids under pressure (e.g., the flow or fall of water; pressure of water, oil or special fluids). These engines or motors may thus operate by directing a moving mass of water on to paddles, blades or helicoidal elements fitted to a wheel.
(A) HYDRAULIC TURBINES
Hydraulic turbines consist of a rotor encased in a stator which directs jets of water on to the blades, etc., of the rotor.
Hydraulic turbines are mainly of three types :
(1) Pelton type, for high-pressure water supply of comparatively small volume. The rotor consists of a wheel fitted radially around its periphery with a large number of cups. The stator consists merely of a strong casing with one or more jets directing the water tangentially on to the cups.
(2) Francis type, for medium or low water pressure at large volume. These comprise a one-piece cast steel rotor with large, fixed helicoidal blades, and a stator consisting of conduit tubing, usually spiralled, with large, variable angle guide blades ensuring a radial flow of water around the whole periphery of the rotor, and an axial water-outlet.
(3) Kaplan type, for low pressure supplies. These are turbines, closely resembling those described above, both the stator and rotor having adjustable angle blades.
The main use of hydraulic turbines is in hydro-electric installations.
(B) WATER WHEELS
These very simple engines consist of a large wheel fitted with flat or hollow paddles of wood or metal around its periphery, the axle of the wheel being generally fitted with a step-up gear. The mechanical power produced is generally used directly in small workshops, saw-mills, flour-mills, etc.
Paddle-wheels for boats, although similar in appearance, are excluded (heading 84.87).
Hydrometric paddle-wheels are also excluded (heading 90.15).
PARTS
Subject to the general provisions regarding the classification of parts (see the General Explanatory Note to Section XVI), parts of the hydraulic turbines or water wheels of this heading are also classified here (e.g., rotors, stators, blades and buckets for stators or rotors, casings for spiral conduits, regulators which automatically regulate the flow of water or the angle of the variable pitch rotors or stators, according to type, in order to maintain uniformity of the speed of rotation despite variations in the load, valve needles for regulators)."

8411.99 - Other
This heading covers turbo-jets, turbo-propellers and other gas turbines.
The turbines of this heading are, in general, internal combustion engines which do not usually require any external source of heat as does, for example, a steam turbine.
(A) TURBO-JETS
A turbo-jet consists of a compressor, a combustion system, a turbine and a nozzle, which is a convergent duct placed in the exhaust pipe. The hot pressurised gas exiting from the turbine is converted to a high velocity gas stream by the nozzle. The reaction of this gas stream acting on the engine provides the motive force which may be used to power aircraft. In its simplest form the compressor and turbine are accommodated on a single shaft. In more complex designs the compressor is made in two parts (a two spool compressor) in which the spool of each part is driven by its own turbine through concentric shafting. Another variation is to add a ducted fan usually at the inlet to the compressor and drive this either by a third turbine or connect it to the first compressor spool. The fan acts in the nature of a ducted propeller, most of its output bypassing the compressor and turbine and joining the exhaust jet to provide extra thrust. This version is sometimes called a “bypass fan jet”.
So-called “after-burning” appliances are auxiliary units for mounting in series with certain turbo-jet engines in order to boost their power output for short periods. These appliances have their own fuel supply and utilise the excess oxygen in the gases issuing from the turbo-jet.
(B) TURBO-PROPELLERS
Such engines are similar to turbo-jets, but have a further turbine downstream of the compressor turbine, which is coupled to a conventional propeller such as is used on piston engined aircraft. This latter turbine is sometimes referred to as a “free turbine”, meaning that it is not mechanically coupled to the compressor and compressor turbine shaft. Thus most of the hot pressurised gas leaving the compressor turbine is converted into shaft power by the free turbine instead of being expanded in a nozzle as is the case in turbo-jets. In some cases, the gases leaving the free turbine may be expanded in a nozzle to provide auxiliary jet power and assist the propeller.
(C) OTHER GAS TURBINES
This group includes industrial gas-turbine units which are either specifically designed for industrial use or adapt turbo-jets or turbo-propeller units for uses other than providing motive power for aircraft.
There are two types of cycles :
(1) The simple cycle, in which air is ingested and compressed by the compressor, heated in the combustion system and passed through the turbine, finally exhausting to the atmosphere.
(2) The regenerative cycle, in which air is ingested, compressed and passed through the air pipes of a regenerator. The air is pre-heated by the turbine exhaust and is then passed to the combustion system where it is further heated by the addition of fuel. The air/gas mixture passes through the turbine and is exhausted through the hot gas side of the regenerator and finally to the atmosphere.
There are two types of designs :
(a) The single-shaft gas turbine unit, in which the compressor and turbine are built on a single shaft, the turbine providing power to rotate the compressor and to drive rotating machinery through a coupling. This type of drive is most effective for constant speed applications such as electrical power generation.
(b) The two-shaft gas turbine unit, in which the compressor, combustion system and compressor turbine are accommodated in one unit generally called a gas generator, whilst a second turbine on a separate shaft receives the heated and pressurised gas from the exhaust of the gas generator. This second turbine known as the power turbine is coupled to a driven unit, such as a compressor or pump. Two-shaft gas turbines are normally applied where load demand variations require a range of power and rotational speed from the gas turbine.
These gas turbines are used for marine craft and locomotives, for electrical power generation, and for mechanical drives in the oil and gas, pipeline and petrochemical industries.
This group also includes other gas turbines without a combustion chamber, comprising simply a stator and rotor and which use energy from gases provided by other machines or appliances (e.g., gas generators, diesel engines, free-piston generators) and compressed air or other compressed gas turbines.
PARTS
Subject to the general provisions regarding the classification of parts (see the General Explanatory Note to Section XVI), parts of the engines and motors of this heading are also classified here (e.g., gas turbine rotors, combustion chambers and vents for jet engines, parts of turbo-jet engines (stator rings, with or without blades, rotor discs or wheels, with or without fins, blades and fins), fuel feed regulators, fuel nozzles).

It therefore covers non-electric engines and motors other than steam turbines and other vapour turbines, spark-ignition and compression-ignition internal combustion piston engines, hydraulic turbines, water wheels, turbo-jets, turbo-propellers or other gas turbines.
The heading includes reaction engines (other than turbo-jets), pneumatic power engines and motors, wind engines (windmills), spring-operated or weight-operated motors, etc., certain hydraulic power engines and motors, and certain steam or other vapour power units.
(A) REACTION ENGINES
OTHER THAN TURBO-JETS
(1) Ram-jets.
This is a mechanically simple engine, which can function only on rapidly moving machines. It has no turbo-compressor, the feed air being forced in by the speed of motion alone and compressed in the combustion chamber under the effect of a duct. The motive force is provided by the reaction of the exhaust gases expanding through a nozzle.
(2) Pulse-jets.
This engine differs from the ram-jet in that its outlet nozzle emits a pulsating flow of gas instead of a continuous jet, due to the fact that combustion takes place intermittently. Unlike the ram-jet, it can be started from rest, the pulsing action providing for the intake of air.
Pulse-jets are used in aircraft mainly as an auxiliary take-off.
(3) Rocket engines.
These are reaction engines in which combustion is independent of external air supply, the charge comprising both fuel and the combustion agents.
There are two main types :
(i) Liquid propellant engines. These engines consist of a combustion chamber plus one or more tanks for the storage of propellants, interconnected by a system of tubes and pumps, and a jet-pipe. The pumps are powered by means of a turbine which is fed by a separate gas generator. An important part of this type of rocket engine is formed by the injection-system. The fuels used include ethyl alcohol, hydrazine hydrate, etc., and the combustion agents are hydrogen peroxide, potassium permanganate, liquid oxygen, nitric acid, etc.
(ii) Solid propellant engines. These engines consist of a cylindrical pressure chamber and a jet-pipe. The combustion chamber and the supply of propellant form a whole. The propellant in this type of engine consists of a combustion agent (usually ammonium perchlorate) and a fuel (usually polyurethanes). Certain types employ solid fuels of the nature of the propellants of Chapter 36.
Rockets are classified in this heading only when forming propulsive units proper (e.g., for auxiliary or take-off engines for aircraft, or for fitting to guided missiles or for satellite or spacecraft launch vehicles).
This group excludes :
(a) Anti-hail rockets, life-line rockets and similar rockets of a pyrotechnic type (heading 36.04).
(b) Satellite or spacecraft launch vehicles (heading 88.02).
(c) Guided missiles incorporating power-units (heading 93.06).
(B) HYDRAULIC POWER ENGINES
AND MOTORS
This group includes :
(1) Certain engines, other than turbines or wheels of heading 84.10, producing mechanical power by utilising the energy of the waves or sea swell (Savonius rotor with two semi-cylindrical bladings) or of the tides.
(2) Water column machines operating by the pressure of water on pistons. The water acts on two or more pistons moving inside the cylinders which in turn drive a shaft.
(3) Hydraulic cylinders consisting, for example, of a brass or steel barrel and a piston operated by oil (or other liquid) under pressure applied on one side (single-acting) or on both sides (double-acting) of the piston, the energy of the liquid under pressure being converted into a linear motion. These cylinders are used on machine-tools, construction machinery, steering mechanisms, etc.
(4) Hydraulic valve actuators, presented separately, consisting of a metal casing containing a piston which, by means of a pin perpendicular to the piston rod, converts the linear motion caused by the action of a liquid under pressure into a rotary motion, in order to operate a plug valve or other appliance with a rotating mechanism.
(5) Hydraulic servomotors which perform the role of final or intermediate actuators in feedback control systems or regulating systems. These servomotors are used, e.g., in aircraft.
(6) Hydraulic systems consisting of a hydraulic power unit (comprising essentially a hydraulic pump, an electric motor, control valves and an oil tank), hydraulic cylinders and the pipes or hoses needed to connect the cylinders to the hydraulic power unit, the whole forming a functional unit within the meaning of Note 4 to Section XVI (see the General Explanatory Note to that Section). These systems are used, e.g., to operate civil engineering structures.
(7) “Hydraulic” jet engines (“hydrojets”) for motor boats. These consist of a powerful pump taking in the sea or river water and ejecting it as a high speed jet from an adjustable tube (or tubes) under or behind the boat.
(C) PNEUMATIC POWER ENGINES
AND MOTORS
These engines use an external source of compressed air (or other gases) and, in principle, resemble a steam piston engine or, in some cases, a steam turbine. In suitable cases they may have burners or other heating devices to increase the air pressure (and hence the expansion energy) and also to prevent the cylinders from frosting due to a rapid drop in temperature.
These engines are mainly used in mines for haulage tractors and winches because of their safety as regards fire-damp explosion. They are also used in certain locomotives, on aircraft, in submarines, etc., as auxiliary starting motors for internal combustion engines, and for propelling torpedoes.
This group also includes :
(1) Vane motors, gear motors, axial and radial piston motors for pneumatic transmission.
(2) Pneumatic cylinders consisting, for example, of a brass or steel barrel and a piston operated by compressed air applied on one side (single-acting) or on both sides (double-acting) of the piston, the energy of the gas under pressure being converted into a linear motion. These cylinders are used on machine-tools, construction machinery, steering mechanisms, etc.
(3) Pneumatic valve actuators, presented separately, consisting of a metal casing containing a piston which, by means of a pin perpendicular to the piston rod, converts the linear motion caused by the action of a compressed gas into a rotary motion, in order to operate a plug valve or other appliance with a rotating mechanism.
(D) WIND ENGINES (WINDMILLS)
This group includes all power units (wind engines or wind turbines), which directly convert into mechanical energy the action of the wind on the blades (often of variable pitch) of a propeller or rotor.
Usually mounted on a fairly tall metal pylon, the propellers or rotors have an arm perpendicular to their plane, forming a vane, or some similar device for orientating the apparatus according to the direction of the wind. The motive force is generally transmitted by reduction gearing through a vertical shaft to the power take-off shaft at ground level. Some wind motors (“depression motors”) have hollow blades in which a pressure reduction is developed by rotation, and is transmitted to the ground by airtight conduits to drive a small reaction turbine.
Wind motors are usually of low power, and are mainly used in rural installations for driving irrigation pumps, drainage pumps or small electric generators.
Electric generator units composed of wind motors mounted integrally with an electric generator (including those for operation in aircraft slipstreams) are excluded (heading 85.02).
(E) SPRING-OPERATED OR WEIGHT-OPERATED MOTORS, ETC.
These include mechanisms which, like clockworks, use the energy produced by the release of wound-up springs, or which are operated by gravity (e.g., by a counterweight or any similar device). However, such mechanisms fitted, or adapted for fitting, with escapements are excluded (heading 91.08 or 91.09).
The motors of this group, particularly those of the spring-driven type, are used to operate a large variety of apparatus (e.g., musical boxes, automatic turnspits, revolving window displays, registering apparatus, engraving tools).
(F) PISTON ENGINES
NOT INCORPORATING BOILERS
In these types the mechanical energy is produced by displacement of a piston inside a cylinder by the application of the pressure difference between the steam produced by the boiler and the atmospheric pressure (non-condensing engines) or the lower pressure of a condenser (condensing engines). The reciprocating or oscillating action of the piston is converted into rotary motion through a connecting-rod and crank shaft or flywheel.
The simplest types are the single-action engines in which the steam pressure acts on one end of the piston only; in other types (double-acting) the steam acts alternately on each end. In the more powerful engines the steam passes successively into two or more cylinders of increasing diameters, the connecting-rods of the respective pistons being coupled to a single crank shaft (compound, double or triple-expansion engines, etc.). Locomotive engines and ships’ engines, for example, belong to this last category.
(G) STEAM OR OTHER VAPOUR POWER UNITS
INCORPORATING BOILERS
The engines of this group comprise a boiler (usually of the firetube type) together with a single expansion or compound piston-type steam engine equipped with one or two flywheels which frequently also act as the power take-offs.
Engines of this kind are essentially of low or medium power output designed for more or less permanent installation but capable, because of their compact structure, of easy dismounting and removal.
PARTS
Subject to the general provisions regarding the classification of parts (see the General Explanatory Note to Section XVI) parts of the engines and motors of this heading are also classified here (e.g., combustion chambers and vents for jet engines, fuel feed regulators, fuel nozzles, windmill airwheels, cylinders, pistons, slide-valves, centrifugal ball or flyweight-type governors, connecting-rods).
In general, parts of steam or other vapour power units incorporating boilers fall to be classified as parts of boilers (heading 84.02) or as parts of steam power units of this heading.
Transmission shafts and crank shafts are, however, excluded (heading 84.83)."

This heading covers most machines and appliances for raising or otherwise continuously displacing volumes of liquids (including molten metal and wet concrete), whether they are operated by hand or by any kind of power unit, integral or otherwise.
The heading also includes delivery pumps equipped with measuring or price-calculating mechanisms such as are used for supplying petrol or oil in garages, and also pumps specially designed for use with other machines, vehicles, etc. (including petrol, oil or water pumps for internal combustion engines, and pumps for man-made textile fibre spinning machines).
The machines of this heading can be subdivided, according to their system of operation, into the following five categories.
(A) RECIPROCATING POSITIVE DISPLACEMENT PUMPS
These use the linear suction or forcing action of a piston or plunger driven within a cylinder, the inlet and outlet being regulated by valves. “Single-acting” pumps utilise the thrust or suction of one end of the piston only; “double-acting” types pump at both ends of the piston thus using both the forward and reverse strokes. In simple “lift” pumps the liquid is merely raised by suction and discharged against atmospheric pressure. In “force” pumps, the compression stroke is used, in addition to the suction stroke, to force the liquid to heights or against pressure. Multi-cylinder pumps are used for increased output. The cylinders may be either in line or in a star shape.
This category includes :
(1) Diaphragm pumps. These incorporate a vibrating membrane of metal, leather, etc. (actuated either directly or through a fluid transmission) by which the liquid is raised.
(2) “Oil-cushion” pumps (for drainage, irrigation, pumping viscous liquids, acids, etc.). In these, a fluid immiscible with the pumped liquid acts as the membrane.
(3) Electro-magnetic pumps. In these, the forward and reverse strokes of the piston are produced by electro-magnetic action (oscillation of a wing placed in a magnetic field).
(4) Machines using the suction or forcing action of two pistons, such as those pumps designed to deliver wet concrete (concrete pumps). However, special purpose vehicles permanently equipped with the concrete pumps of this heading are excluded (heading 87.05).
(B) ROTARY POSITIVE DISPLACEMENT PUMPS
In these also, the intake and discharge of the liquid is effected by suction and compression, in this case produced by cams (lobes) or similar devices, rotated continuously on an axis. These devices make contact, at one or more points with the wall of the body of the pump, and form in this way the chambers in which the liquid is displaced.
They may be classified according to the nature of the rotating mechanism, viz. :
(1) Gear pumps. The liquid is displaced by the teeth of specially shaped gears.
(2) Vane pumps. The rotor is in the form of a cylinder revolving eccentrically and having projecting vanes free to move radially. The rotation permits the sliding vanes to maintain contact with the internal walls of the casing thereby displacing the liquid. This category also includes pumps which, in place of vanes, have rollers or a wheel with small flexible vanes or have a radial sliding vane attached to the body of the pump and rubbing on a smooth rotor turning with an eccentric movement.
(3) Rotary piston lobe type pumps with two interacting displacing elements rotating in a casing.
(4) Helicoidal pumps (screw pumps). In these the liquid is displaced longitudinally in the body of the pump under the pressure of several helicoidal threads meshed together and turning (pumps with two or more screws, pumps with helicoidal spindles, endless screw pumps).
(5) Peristaltic pumps. These have a flexible tube containing the liquid running along the length of the body of the housing and a rotor with rollers at each end. The rollers exert pressure on the flexible tube and the liquid is displaced by the rotational movement.
(C) CENTRIFUGAL PUMPS
In these pumps, liquid taken in axially is set in rotation by the revolving blades of a rotor (impeller), the resulting centrifugal action forcing the liquid outwards to the periphery of an annular casing containing an outlet placed tangentially. The casing is sometimes fitted with divergent vanes (diffuser vanes) to transform the kinetic energy of the fluid into high pressure.
For very high pressures, multi-stage centrifugal pumps are used in which the liquid is directed in stages through a number of impellers on a common shaft.
Centrifugal pumps may be driven by an electric or internal combustion motor or by a turbine. Because of their high working speed they are suitable for direct coupling, whereas piston or rotary pumps require to be driven through reduction gears.
This group also covers submersible pumps, central heating circulating pumps, channel impeller pumps, side channel pumps and radial flow impeller pumps.
(D) OTHER PUMPS
The following pumps fall in this group :
(1) Electro-magnetic pumps. These pumps have no moving parts, the liquid being put into circulation by the phenomenon of electrical conduction. These pumps should not be confused with certain reciprocating positive displacement pumps in which the in-and-out movement of a piston is obtained by electro-magnetic effect, nor with those which function by magnetic induction.
(2) Ejectors. In this type of pump, the kinetic energy of a jet of air, steam, water, etc., under pressure ejected from a tube, induces a suction and entrainment effect on the liquid handled. These pumps comprise a complex system of divergent and convergent pipes in a closed chamber from which the system of pipes emerges.
Injectors of the Giffard type for supplying water to boilers, and injection pumps for internal combustion piston engines, working on the same principle, are also classified here.
(3) Emulsion pumps (gas lift pumps). In these, the liquid is mixed with compressed gas in the outlet pipe, the decrease in density of the emulsified liquid thus providing the lift. When compressed air is used, the pump is referred to as an air lift pump.
(4) Pumps in which the steam or gas pressure acts directly on the surface of the liquid. Examples are :
(a) Gas combustion pumps employing the explosive force of a suitable fuel or gas to lift liquids.
(b) Steam pulsators (pulsometers), in which the delivery of the liquid pumped is achieved by displacement due to the steam entering the chamber of the pulsator; the suction is created by the subsequent pressure drop due to the condensation of the steam in the chamber.
(c) Compressed air chamber elevators (Montejus) using compressed air.
(d) Hydraulic rams, in which the increase in the energy of a moving liquid column resulting from the periodic and sudden arrest of the flow of the liquid in the supply line is used to pump a portion of the driving liquid in the discharge pipe of the apparatus.
(E) LIQUID ELEVATORS
These include :
(1) Elevating wheels, with buckets, scoops, etc.
(2) Chain or cable elevators with buckets, scoops, rubber cups, etc.
(3) Band elevators. These consist of endless bands of textile or metal (corrugated, multi-cellular or spiral), in which the water is held by capillarity and ejected centrifugally.
(4) Archimedean screw-type elevators.
PARTS
Subject to the general provisions regarding the classification of parts (see the General Explanatory Note to Section XVI), parts of the goods of this heading are also classified here, e.g., pump housings or bodies; rods specially designed to connect and drive the piston in pumps placed at some distance from the prime mover (e.g., pumping rods, “sucker rods”); pistons, plungers, vanes; cams (lobes); helicoidal screws, impeller wheels, diffuser vanes; buckets and bucket-fitted chains; bands for band-type liquid elevators; pressure chambers.
The heading also excludes :
(a) Pumps (e.g., for corrosive fluids) of ceramic material (heading 69.09).
(b) Hand powered oil cans and grease guns (heading 82.05) and compressed air grease guns (heading 84.67).

Subheading Explanatory Note.
Subheadings 8413.11 and 8413.19
These subheadings cover only those pumps, of whatever type, which form, or have been designed to form, a unit with a device permitting the volumetric control of the quantity of liquid discharged, whether or not this device is presented at the same time as the pump.
This control device may be very simple (for example, a calibrated globe or unit) or, on the contrary, consist of more complex mechanisms automatically controlling the stopping of the pump when a given total quantity is discharged (such as, for example, a delivery pump comprising a calibrated cylinder (measuring cylinder) and a device permitting, on the one hand, the determining of a desired quantity and, on the other, stopping the pump motor when the predetermined quantity is obtained) or fulfilling other operations connected with volumetric control proper (for example, pumps for integration of totals, prepayment pumps, price-calculating pumps, sampling pumps, automatic mixture regulating pumps and automatic dosage pumps).
On the other hand, when, for example, the measuring device is designed to be simply mounted on the tube through which the liquid set in motion by the pump flows, each of the two units (pump and measuring device) are to be classified in their own headings, even when presented together.
These subheadings cover, for example, pumps for delivering petrol or other motor fuels and lubricants as well as pumps with a measuring device for use in food shops, laboratories and various industrial activities."

This heading covers machines and appliances, hand-operated or power driven, for the compression of air or other gases, or for creating a vacuum, and also machines for circulating air or other gases.
(A) PUMPS AND COMPRESSORS
In general, air pumps, vacuum pumps and compressors function on the same principles as and are broadly of similar construction to the liquid pumps (piston, rotary, centrifugal or ejector pumps) described under the preceding heading.
In addition, however, there are certain special types, particularly for producing high vacua, such as diffusion pumps (the pump fluid being oil or mercury), molecular pumps and entrapment pumps (getter pumps, cryopumps). Diffusion pumps, however, are sometimes made of glass, in which case they are excluded (Chapter 70).
Air and vacuum pumps serve many purposes : for facilitating boiling, distilling or evaporating at reduced pressure; for evacuating electric lamps or tubes, vacuum flasks, etc. Air pumps serve for pumping air at pressure (e.g., for inflating pneumatic tyres).
Unlike liquid pumps, air or other gas compressors (other than low pressure or intermittent working compressors) are water-cooled or have fins or other means for air cooling (surface cooling) to dissipate the considerable heat of compression which is generated.
There are several types of compressors, for example, reciprocating piston, centrifugal, axial and rotary compressors. A special type of compressor is the exhaust-gas turbocharger used in internal-combustion piston engines to increase power output.
Compressors are widely used : for compressing gases into gas cylinders; in chemical processes; for refrigerators, etc. and for compressing air or other gases in reservoirs to be used to force feed machines or apparatus such as compressed air engines, pneumatic picks, winches, brakes, pneumatic conveyor tubes, submarine ballast tanks, etc.
The heading also includes free-piston generators for gas turbines, consisting of two horizontally-opposed driving pistons sliding in a common cylinder which is extended and enlarged at each end to form compression cylinders in which slide two other pistons, connected to the driving pistons, forming a pneumatic recoil. The driving pistons are forced apart by the explosion of an ignited gas, thus displacing the compression pistons. The return stroke of the compression pistons compresses air admitted into the compression cylinders, and forces it through exhaust valves together with the exhaust gases. The high pressure of the hot gases enables them to be applied directly to the rotors of gas turbines, the generator thus replacing the usual combustion chamber and compressor of the gas turbine.
As in the case of the pumps of heading 84.13, the air pumps and compressors of this group may be built with integral motors or turbines, the latter being most often employed for high pressure compressors operating on the principle of the multi-stage gas turbine in reverse.
(B) FANS
These machines, which may or may not be fitted with integral motors, are designed either for delivering large volumes of air or other gases at relatively low pressure or merely for creating a movement of the surrounding air.
Those of the first kind may act as air extractors or as blowers (e.g., industrial blowers used in wind tunnels). They consist of a propeller or blade-type impeller revolving in a casing or conduit, and function on the principle of rotary or centrifugal compressors.
The second type are of more simple construction, and consist merely of a driven fan rotating in free air.
Fans are used, inter alia, for ventilating mines and premises of all kinds, silos, ships; for extracting by suction dust, steam, smoke, hot gases, etc.; for drying many materials (leather, paper, textiles, paint, etc.); in mechanical draught apparatus for furnaces.
This group also includes room fans, whether or not with a tilting or oscillating device. These include ceiling fans, table fans, wall bracket fans, ring mounted fans for building into walls, window panes, etc.
This heading excludes fans fitted with elements additional to their motors or housing (such as large dust separating cones, filters, cooling or heating elements and heat exchangers) if such elements give them the characteristics of more complex machines of other headings, e.g., air heaters, not electrically heated (heading 73.22), air conditioning machines (heading 84.15), dust extractors (heading 84.21), air coolers for the industrial treatment of materials (heading 84.19) or for premises (heading 84.79), electric space heating apparatus with built-in fans (heading 85.16).
(C) VENTILATING OR RECYCLING HOODS INCORPORATING A FAN, WHETHER OR NOT FITTED WITH FILTERS
This group includes cooker hoods incorporating a fan, for use in the home or in restaurants, canteens, hospitals, etc., as well as laboratory hoods and industrial hoods incorporating a fan.
Compressors, air pumps, fans, blowers, etc., specially constructed for use with other machines remain classified in this heading and not as parts of such other machines.
PARTS
Subject to the general provisions regarding the classification of parts (see the General Explanatory Note to Section XVI), parts of the goods of this heading are also classified here (e.g., pump or compressor bodies, blades, rotors or impellers, vanes and pistons).
This heading also excludes :
(a) Exhaust-gas turbines (heading 84.11).
(b) Emulsion pumps (heading 84.13).
(c) Pneumatic elevators and conveyors (heading 84.28).
(d) Machines for cleaning, sorting or grading seed, grain or dried leguminous vegetables (heading 84.37)."
14,8415,"84.15 - Air conditioning machines, comprising a motor-driven fan and elements for changing the temperature and humidity, including those machines in which the humidity cannot be separately regulated (+).
8415.10 - Of a kind designed to be fixed to a window, wall, ceiling or floor, self-contained or “split-system”
8415.20 - Of a kind used for persons, in motor vehicles
- Other :
8415.81 - Incorporating a refrigerating unit and a valve for reversal of the cooling/heat cycle (reversible heat pumps)
8415.82 - Other, incorporating a refrigerating unit
8415.83 - Not incorporating a refrigerating unit
8415.90 - Parts
This heading covers certain apparatus for maintaining required conditions of temperature and humidity in closed spaces. The machines may also comprise elements for the purification of air.
They are used for air conditioning offices, homes, public halls, ships, motor vehicles, etc., and also in certain industrial installations requiring special atmospheric conditions (e.g., in the textile, paper, tobacco or food industries).
The heading applies only to machines :
(1) Equipped with a motor-driven fan or blower, and
(2) Designed to change both the temperature (a heating or cooling element or both) and the humidity (a humidifying or drying element or both) of air, and
(3) For which the elements mentioned in (1) and (2) are presented together.
In these machines the elements for humidifying or drying the air may be separate from those for heating or cooling it. However, certain types incorporate only a single unit which changes both the temperature and, by condensation, the humidity of the air. These air conditioning machines cool and dry (by condensation of water vapour on a cold coil) the air of the room in which they are installed or, if they have an outside air intake (damper), a mixture of fresh air and room air. They are generally provided with drip pans to catch the condensate.
The machines may be in the form of single units encompassing all the required elements, such as self-contained window or wall types (referred to as “through-the-wall” units). Alternatively, they may be in the form of “split-systems” which operate when connected together, i.e., a condenser unit for external installation plus an evaporator unit for internal installation. These “split-systems” are ductless and utilize a separate evaporator for each area to be air conditioned (e.g., each room).
From the structural point of view, the air conditioning machines of this heading must therefore incorporate, in addition to the motor-driven fan or blower for circulating the air, at least the following elements :
An air heating device (operated by hot water, steam or hot air tubes or by electric resistances, etc.) and an air humidifier (generally consisting of a water spray) or an air de-humidifier;
or A cold water coil or a refrigerator unit evaporator (either of which changes both the temperature and, by condensation, the humidity of the air);
or Some other type of cooling element with a separate device for changing the humidity of the air.
In certain cases, the de-humidifier makes use of the hygroscopic properties of absorbent materials.
This heading covers, inter alia, reversible heat pumps designed, through a single system fitted with a valve for reversal of the cooling/heat cycle, to perform the dual function of heating and cooling premises. In the cooling cycle, the reversing valve directs the flow of hot, high pressure vapour to the outdoor coil where the heat released during condensation is fanned into the outdoor air and then compressed refrigerant flows into an indoor coil where it vaporizes and absorbs heat and cools the air that is driven around the premises by a fan. In the heating cycle, the shifting of the valve for reversal of the cooling/heat cycle causes the refrigerant flow to reverse so that the heat is released inside the premises.
Air conditioning machines may be supplied with their means of heating or cooling from an external source. They are usually fitted with air cleaners consisting of one or more layers of filtering material, often impregnated with oil (textile material, glass wool, steel or copper wool, expanded metal, etc.) through which the air is passed to remove suspended dust, etc. They may also be provided with devices for adjusting or automatically controlling the temperature and humidity of the air.
This heading also covers apparatus which, although not fitted with a device for separately regulating the humidity of the air, change the humidity by condensation. Examples of such apparatus are the above-mentioned self-contained units and split-systems which utilize a separate evaporator for each area to be air conditioned (e.g., each room), and also apparatus for cold stores consisting of a combined cooling evaporator and motorized blower. Also included are units for heating/cooling a closed chamber (lorry, trailer or container), consisting of a compressor, a condenser and a motor in a housing mounted on the outside of the goods compartment and of a ventilator and an evaporator within the container.
However, the heading excludes refrigeration units designed to maintain a fixed temperature well below 0° C in a closed chamber (e.g., lorry, trailer or container), and fitted with a heating system to raise the temperature in the chamber, within certain limits, when the outside temperature is very low. Such equipment is classifiable in heading 84.18 as refrigerating or freezing equipment, the heating function being subsidiary to the equipment’s essential function, which is to keep perishable products cool during transportation.
PARTS
In accordance with the provisions of Note 2 (b) to Section XVI, this heading includes separately presented indoor units and outdoor units for split-system air conditioning machines of this heading.
Other parts for air-conditioning machines, whether or not designed for building into a self-contained unit, are to be classified in accordance with the provisions of Note 2 (a) to Section XVI (headings 84.14, 84.18, 84.19, 84.21, 84.79, etc.) or, if Note 2 (a) is not applicable, in accordance with Note 2 (b) or 2 (c) to Section XVI, depending on whether or not they are identifiable as suitable for use solely or principally with the air-conditioning machines of which they are parts.
The heading excludes :
(a) Air heaters and hot air distributors of heading 73.22 which can also distribute fresh or conditioned air.
(b) Non- reversible heat pumps of heading 84.18 and chillers for air conditioning machines (heading 84.18).
(c) Apparatus which, although incorporating a motor-driven fan, has the sole function of changing either the temperature or humidity of the air (headings 84.79, 85.16, etc.).

Subheading Explanatory Notes.
Subheading 8415.10
This subheading covers air conditioning machines of a kind designed to be fixed to a window, wall, ceiling or floor, self-contained or “split-system”.
The term “fixed” means placed or set into position in a more or less permanent manner, taking into account factors such as size, weight, physical construction (e.g. the presence or absence of castors or handles), interconnections, etc.
The self-contained type air conditioners are in the form of single units encompassing all the required elements and being self-contained.
The “split-system” type air conditioners are ductless and utilize a separate evaporator for each area to be air conditioned (e.g., each room).
The indoor heat exchanger unit may be mounted in various locations, for example, in a wall or window, or on a ceiling or floor.
However, this subheading excludes ducted central air conditioning systems which utilize ducts to carry refrigerated air from an evaporator to several areas to be cooled.
Subheading 8415.20
This subheading covers equipment which is intended mainly for passenger motor vehicles of all kinds, but which may also be fitted in other kinds of motor vehicles, for air conditioning the cabs or compartments in which persons are accommodated.
Subheading 8415.90
This subheading includes both indoor and outdoor units for split-system air conditioning machines of subheading 8415.10 when presented separately. The units are designed to be connected by electrical wiring and copper tubing through which refrigerant passes between the indoor and outdoor units."

8416.30 - Mechanical stokers, including their mechanical grates, mechanical ash dischargers and similar appliances
8416.90 - Parts
This heading covers a range of apparatus for the mechanical or automatic firing and stoking of furnaces of all kinds, and for evacuating the ash and cinders.
(A) FURNACE BURNERS
These project a flame directly into the furnace, and dispense with the need for a grate and for ash removal. They include the following types :
(1) Heavy oil burners (atomisers).
In these the heavy fuel is atomised in the air stream, in some cases by compressed air and in others by high pressure steam or mechanically (the latter types of apparatus usually incorporate a motor, a pump and an air blower).
(2) Pulverised coal burners.
These are often of large size. A jet of pulverised coal is forced into the furnace by means of an air blast which also provides the primary air supply. The burners may sometimes incorporate a coal conveyor and a grinding mill. In another type, soft coal is pulverised and injected intermittently by the alternate action of high or low pressure steam.
(3) Gas burners.
These include both high pressure types for use with forced draught, and low pressure types for use with atmospheric air. The air and gas is in either case fed through concentric or converging tubes.
(4) Combination burners.
These provide for the simultaneous combustion of oil, gas and powdered coal, or any two of them.
(B) MECHANICAL STOKERS, MECHANICAL GRATES,
MECHANICAL ASH DISCHARGERS
AND SIMILAR APPLIANCES
These are various mechanical appliances for feeding solid fuels to furnaces, or for forming the fire bed. Mechanical stokers and mechanical grates are frequently combined and also equipped with devices for the automatic removal of the slag and ash after combustion, thus forming a fully automatic installation. In other cases a mechanical or automatic element may be combined with a non-mechanical element.
(1) Mechanical stokers.
These are of widely differing types. They usually comprise a coal hopper together with various devices such as Archimedean screws, mechanical shovels, sliding trays, propelling pistons, operated by hand or by power, for regulating the supply of coal and conveying it to the furnace bed. These appliances are often fitted with breakers for reducing the coal supply to uniform size. The heading covers mechanical stokers for central heating (including domestic) boilers.
(2) Mechanical grates.
These are appliances of varying design by which the coal is distributed over the fire-bed and moved forward through the furnace to secure even combustion. The most common systems are based on the principle of the caterpillar band, or take the form of oscillating inclined steps. These grates often terminate with appliances for removing the slag and ash. In other systems the slag and ash removal is effected by separate mechanical units; these are also classified in this heading.
PARTS
Subject to the general provisions regarding the classification of parts (see the General Explanatory Note to Section XVI), parts of the goods of this heading are also classified here (e.g., burner nozzles, thrust pistons and trays for mechanical stokers; chassis for mechanical grates, link sections and links, guides and rolls for mechanical grates).
The heading does not cover non-mechanical fire-bars or grates, industrial or other. Fire-boxes consisting of fixed grates in a metal body designed to be fitted as an integral part into certain types of boilers are excluded and are regarded as parts of boilers and fall in heading 84.02. Similarly, certain other types of non-mechanical grates which are identifiable as specialised for particular machines or appliances are classified as parts for such machines and appliances (e.g., for gas generators - heading 84.05). On the other hand, iron fire-bars and grates of general use, for fitting into brickwork, are classified in heading 73.21, 73.22 or 73.26 according to type."

(I) REFRIGERATORS, FREEZERS AND
OTHER REFRIGERATING OR FREEZING EQUIPMENT
The refrigerators and refrigerating equipment of this heading are in the main machines or assemblies of apparatus for the production, in a continuous cycle of operations, of low temperatures (in the region of 0 °C or less) at the active cooling element, by the absorption of the latent heat of evaporation of liquefied gases (e.g., ammonia, halogenated hydrocarbons), of volatile liquids or, in the case of certain marine types, of water.
The heading therefore excludes :
(a) Freezing salt type freezers (heading 82.10 or 84.19).
(b) Water flow coolers of the simple heat exchange type (see the Explanatory Note to heading 84.19).
(c) Ice chests, insulated cabinets, etc., not designed for fitting with refrigerating units (generally heading 94.03).
The refrigerators of this heading are of two main types :
(A) COMPRESSION TYPE REFRIGERATORS
Their essential elements are :
(1) The compressor which receives expanded gas from the evaporator and delivers it under pressure to
(2) The condenser or liquefier where the gas is cooled and liquefied, and
(3) The evaporator, the active cooling element, consisting of a tubular system in which the condensed refrigerant, released through an expansion valve, evaporates rapidly with the absorption of heat from the surrounding air or, in the case of large cooling installations, from brine or a solution of calcium chloride kept in circulation around the evaporator coils.
In the marine type there is no compressor and condenser in the refrigerant (water or brine) circuit, but the evaporation is induced by a vacuum produced by an ejector pump working with a steam condenser. The latter condenses and disposes of the vapours produced, which are not returned to the system.
(B) ABSORPTION TYPE REFRIGERATORS
In these the compressor is replaced by a “generator” in which a strong aqueous solution of ammonia is heated (by gas, oil or electric element), the gas being driven off and accumulating under pressure in the condenser. The cycle of condensation followed by expansion and cooling in the evaporator continues as in the compressor type, the expanded gas being re dissolved in the weakened solution, either in a separate absorber which feeds the generator by simple pressure effect or through a pump, or in the generator itself which, in certain types, functions as the absorber on cooling during periods when the heat is withdrawn.
In certain dry types the ammonia gas is absorbed by a solid (e.g., calcium chloride or silica gel) instead of being in solution.
Apparatus of the foregoing kinds are classified in this heading if in the following forms :
(1) Units comprising a compressor (with or without motor) and condenser mounted on a common base, whether or not complete with evaporator; or self contained absorption units. (These units are commonly fitted into domestic type refrigerators or other refrigerating cabinets.) Certain compression type machines, known as “liquid cooling units”, combine on a common base (with or without condensers), compressors and a heat exchanger containing an evaporator and tubing carrying the liquid to be cooled. These latter machines include those known as “chillers”, which are used in air conditioning systems.
(2) Cabinets or other furniture or appliances incorporating a complete refrigerating unit or an evaporator of a refrigerating unit, whether or not equipped with ancillary devices such as agitators, mixers, moulds. These appliances include domestic refrigerators, refrigerated show cases and counters, ice cream or frozen food storage containers, refrigerated water or beverage fountains, milk cooling vats, beer coolers, ice cream makers, etc.
(3) Refrigerating installations of larger type consisting of components which are not mounted on a common base or as self contained units but are designed to operate together, either by direct expansion (an evaporator then being incorporated in the “cold using” appliance), or by means of a refrigerating medium (brine) which is cooled by a refrigerating unit and piped into the “cold using” appliances (indirect cooling). Such installations are used, for example, in cold storage plants and for manufacturing operations (manufacture of block ice, quick freezing of food products, rapid chilling in chocolate manufacture, separating paraffin wax in petroleum refining, in chemical industries, etc.).
Ancillary apparatus essential to the application of the low temperature produced in such installations are classified in this heading provided they are presented together with the other components of these installations. Such apparatus include, for example, sectional or tunnel type quick freezers, cold tables for confectionery or chocolate, etc.
This heading also includes refrigerating equipment operating by vaporisation of liquefied gas in an enclosed space and consisting generally of one or more liquefied gas tanks, a thermostat, an electro magnetic valve, a control box and electric switches and a perforated spreader tube. These components are classified here if presented together.
(II) HEAT PUMPS
A heat pump is a device which draws heat from a suitable heat source (principally underground or surface water, the soil or the air) and converts it with the assistance of a supplementary energy source (e.g., gas or electricity) into a source of more intense heat.
A heat transfer fluid is generally used to transfer the heat from the source to the heat pump and from the heat pump to the medium to be treated.
There are two types of heat pumps : the compression type and the absorption type.
Compression heat pumps consist essentially of the following elements :
(1) an evaporator which extracts energy from the environment and transmits it to the heat transfer fluid;
(2) a compressor which, by mechanical means, draws off the vaporised fluid from the evaporator and transfers it at increased pressure to the condenser;
(3) a condenser, which is a heat exchanger in which the vapour liquefies, giving up heat to the medium to be treated;
In absorption heat pumps, the compressor is replaced by a boiler containing water and a refrigerant and incorporating a burner.
Heat pumps are usually designated by the association of two factors, the first being the initial source of the heat and the second the medium whose temperature is to be modified. Among the principal types of apparatus are :
(i) Air/water or air/air heat pumps, which draw ambient heat from the atmosphere and restore it in the form of warm water or warm air.
(ii) Water/water or water/air heat pumps, which obtain heat from an underground source or from a mass of surface water.
(iii) Earth/water or earth/air heat pumps : in these, heat is obtained by means of a system of tubes buried in the earth.
Heat pumps may be presented as a single item of apparatus, the various elements of the circuit forming a unit. Such a unit is referred to as a monobloc type. They may also be presented as several separate items. Certain heat pumps may be presented without an evaporator when they are intended for installation in plant already containing one. They are, in such cases, to be considered as incomplete articles having the essential character of the complete articles and remain classified here.
Heat pumps are used essentially to heat buildings or provide domestic hot water. Non reversible heat pumps are generally used for these purposes.
However, the heading excludes reversible heat pumps comprising a motor driven fan and elements for changing both the temperature and the humidity. These are regarded as air conditioning machines of heading 84.15.
PARTS

With these exceptions, the heading covers machinery and plant designed to submit materials (solid, liquid or gaseous) to a heating or cooling process in order to cause a simple change of temperature, or to cause a transformation of the materials resulting principally from the temperature change (e.g., heating, cooking, roasting, distilling, rectifying, sterilising, pasteurising, steaming, drying, evaporating, vaporising, condensing or cooling processes). But the heading excludes machinery and plant in which the heating or cooling, even if essential, is merely a secondary function designed to facilitate the main mechanical function of the machine or plant, e.g., machines for coating biscuits, etc., with chocolate, and conches (heading 84.38), washing machines (heading 84.50 or 84.51), machines for spreading and tamping bituminous road surfacing materials (heading 84.79).
The machinery and plant classified in this heading may or may not incorporate mechanical equipment.
They may be heated by any system (coal, oil, gas, steam, electricity, etc.), except in the case of instantaneous water heaters and storage water heaters which are classified in heading 85.16 when heated electrically.
The heading covers only non-domestic equipment, except for the instantaneous or storage water heaters referred to later in this Explanatory Note.
The heading includes a very wide range of machinery and plant of the types described below.
(I) HEATING OR COOLING PLANT AND MACHINERY
This group covers plant of general use in many industries for the simple treatment of materials by heating, boiling, cooking, concentration, evaporation, vaporisation, cooling, etc. They include :
(A) Vessels, vats, etc., of various kinds for heating or cooling :
(1) Vessels, vats, etc., for indirect heating or cooling with double walls or bottoms incorporating provision for the circulation of steam, chilled brine or other heating or cooling media. However, double-walled or double-bottomed vessels fall in Section XIV or Section XV (e.g., heading 73.09) if they do not have such provision for circulating heating or cooling media (e.g., heat insulated containers) or in heading 84.18 if they incorporate an evaporator of a refrigerating unit (direct cooling).
(2) Single wall vessels, vats, etc., incorporating provision for direct heating (including heating by perforated steam coils) other than such vessels normally used in the household (heading 73.21, generally). In general, the industrial types are distinguished by their large size and solid construction, or the provision of filters or condensing domes or of mechanical devices such as agitators or tippers.
Such vessels, whether of the single or double walled type, are frequently constructed for working under high pressure (e.g., autoclaves), or at reduced pressures for special purposes, particularly in the chemical and allied industries.
Vessels fitted with mechanical devices but not incorporating means of direct or indirect heating fall in heading 84.79 unless clearly designed as machinery of a type specified in another heading.
This group of heating vessels includes pasteurisers, sometimes operating at reduced pressure, used to submit food or drink products (milk, butter, wines, beers, etc.) to pre determined temperatures to eliminate harmful micro organisms.
(B) Heat exchange units in which a hot fluid (hot gas, steam or hot liquid) and a cold fluid are made to traverse parallel paths, but usually in opposite directions, separated by thin metal walls in such a manner that the one fluid is cooled and the other heated. These units are usually of the three following types, viz., in the form of :
(i) Concentric tube systems : one fluid flows in the annular interval, the other in the central tube.
(ii) A tubular system for the one fluid, enclosed in a chamber through which flows the other fluid.
or (iii) Two parallel series of interconnected narrow chambers formed of baffle plates.
As stated in the first paragraph of this Explanatory Note (exclusion (e)), the heading does not include auxiliary plant for steam generating boilers (heading 84.04) much of which (e.g., steam condensers, air pre heaters and economisers) are of the general type of heat exchange unit mentioned above.
The following are examples of machinery and plant which, subject to the provisions referred to above, are covered by Part (I) of this Explanatory Note :
(1) Freezing salt type freezers (other than those of heading 82.10).
(2) Condensers for nitrogen or other gases.
(3) Pasteurising, concentrating, cooling, etc., plant for milk (including storage vats with cooling equipment).
(4) Processing and maturing vats for the cheese industry.
(5) Plant for concentrating, cooling, etc., fruit juices, wines, etc.
(6) Plant for use in agriculture (e.g., autoclaves for cooking potatoes, etc., as fodder; hot water baths for re melting honeycombs, including those with pressing screws).
(7) Cooling columns (e.g., for the bread grain milling industry).
(8) Autoclaves and steaming, boiling, cooking, frying, etc., plant for cooking, preparing or preserving food (e.g., cooking chests for ham; fish friers; cookers, blanching autoclaves, etc., for fruit, vegetables, etc.; autoclaves and coolers for the canning or preserving industry; jam boilers; confectionery boilers).
(9) Macerating vessels and mashing vats with heating equipment; vessels for the decoction of hops; beer pasteurisers, coolers, etc.
(10) Defecation vessels, juice concentration plant, vacuum boiling pans, carbonation, sulphiting or refining vats, etc., for use in the sugar industry.
Diffusing apparatus (diffusor vessel and “calorisator” presented together), for extracting the juice from sugar beet, are excluded (see Part (V) (B) (3) of Explanatory Note to heading 84.38); “calorisators” presented separately are, however, classified in this heading.
(11) Autoclaves for melting tallow or for saponifying fats; margarine solidifying tanks, incorporating a cooled rotating cylinder on to which the margarine solidifies.
(12) Vats, vessels, autoclaves, etc., for the chemical preparation of wood pulp or for the hydrolysis of wood.
(13) Vats, etc., for the preparation of dyes.
(14) Autoclaves for vulcanising rubber.
(15) Vats, etc., for pickling or de greasing metals.
(16) Immersion coils consisting of an assembly of plastic tubes, placed in parallel or braided, and sealed at each end into a honeycomb structure to which a connector is attached. When immersed in a bath, these devices will keep it at a constant temperature, or heat or cool it, by means of a fluid or steam circulating in the tubes.
(17) Specialised heating or cooking apparatus which are not normally used in the household (e.g., counter type coffee percolators, tea or milk urns, steam kettles, etc., used in restaurants, canteens, etc.; steam heated cookers, hot plates, warming cupboards, drying cabinets, etc.; deep fat friers).
(18) Automatic hot or cold beverage-dispensing machines without a device to accept payment.
The apparatus described above is essentially used industrially, but the heading also covers non electric instantaneous water heaters and storage water heaters, including solar water heaters, domestic or not. If electrically heated, such appliances are excluded (heading 85.16).
It is to be noted that this heading excludes domestic steamers, pressure cookers and certain percolators, of base metal (Section XV).
(II) DISTILLING OR RECTIFYING PLANT
With the exception of distillation apparatus of ceramics (heading 69.09) or of glass (heading 70.17 or 70.20), this group comprises all plant designed for distilling substances (whether liquid or solid).
(A) Simple distillation plant.
This consists essentially of a retort or still body in which the liquid to be distilled is vaporised, a cooling device for condensing the vapours issuing from the retort and a receptacle(s) in which the distillate(s) is collected. They may be arranged for intermittent use (e.g., simple batch stills heated directly or by internal steam coils), or for continuous use, in which case the still body is fed continuously with liquid and is usually heated by steam tubes or coils. Continuous stills may be connected in series, the first being heated directly or with steam while the others are fed by the distillate and heated by the distillation vapours from the preceding still.
(B) Fractionating or rectifying plant.
These are more complicated continuous installations incorporating vertical fractionating columns which enable complex mixtures to be separated in one operation. The most usual type of column is divided into interconnecting sections by plates fitted with bubbling caps and down flow tubes. Vapour rising from one section is thus brought into intimate contact with a condensed portion of the vapour in the section above and, since the temperature decreases as the vapours rise in the column, they can be separated at different levels corresponding to their boiling points.
Plant for distilling solids (coal, lignite, wood, etc.) work on the same principle, but the products are heated in furnaces classified in heading 84.17. This heading covers only the condensing or rectifying plant used for separating the volatile products evolved in the furnace.
The essential parts of distilling, etc., plants are usually made of metal (e.g., stainless steel, copper or nickel), but they may be lined with glass or refractory material. Plant for distillation at reduced or increased pressure may be fitted with vacuum pumps or compressors.
Batch stills are mainly used for the preparation of essential oils, liqueurs, etc. Continuous distillation plant (simple or fractional) is used in many industries (e.g., for the distillation of industrial alcohols, fatty acids, liquid air, synthetic motor fuels or chemical products; in crude petroleum refining; for the distillation of wood, coal, shale, lignite, coal tar).
Also included in this group are separators for irradiated fuels or for processing effluents, operating by fractional distillation.
(III) EVAPORATING OR DRYING PLANT
This plant is constructed in various designs (sometimes for operation in vacuo), to suit different types of materials and their sensitivity to heat. It may be heated directly or indirectly. The heading applies, however, only to plant evaporating or drying at a relatively low temperature, and is not to be confused with the industrial furnaces or ovens of heading 84.17 in which much higher temperatures are developed.
The most common forms of the industrial appliances of this heading are :
(A) Evaporators. These usually take the form of vessels, providing a large surface heated directly or indirectly by steam coils, and often equipped with an evacuator for removing the vapours produced. They may be single or multiple effect, the latter being similar in operation and construction to multiple effect stills but without provision for the recuperation of the condensed vapour.
(B) Laboratory lyophilisation apparatus and freeze drying units. These are used for the stabilising and preservation by dehydration of biological specimens such as antitoxins, bacteria, viruses, plasma and serums. The specimens are frozen, and then allowed to reheat gently under very low pressure when the ice sublimes leaving the dehydrated product.
(C) Tunnel dryers. These consist of large chambers generally provided with conveyor equipment on which the products are conveyed through the chambers at a suitable speed against a current of hot air. They are used, inter alia, in pottery; in glass making; in the food industry (including plant incorporating provision for smoking fish, meat, etc.); for drying wood, hay, etc.
(D) Rotary dryers. These consist of revolving cylinders or drums which may be heated internally or externally. They are used in various industries (paper making, preparation of potato flakes, etc.).
(E) Plate dryers. These consist of metal chambers fitted with a number of horizontal slotted plates or shelves, sometimes internally heated. A central revolving shaft fitted with grids spreads the material over the hot plates and directs it downwards through the slots to each succeeding plate. This type of plant is used for treating malted barley.
(F) Spray dryers. These function as evaporators, and consist of metal chambers fitted internally with a horizontal disc revolving at high speed. They incorporate a heater and fan to provide a current of hot air through which the liquid material is dispersed centrifugally as a fine spray by the revolving disc; the liquid is thus dried instantaneously in powder form. In another type the liquid is injected into the chamber as a fine spray against a counter current of hot air. This type is used particularly for the preparation of powdered milk.
This group also includes machinery and apparatus for the evaporation of fissile solutions or radioactive solutions or for drying fissile or radioactive products.
The heading does not, however, include :
(a) Centrifuges for drying radioactive precipitates (heading 84.21).
(b) Machinery for drying bottles or other containers (heading 84.22).
(c) Machinery specialised for the drying of textile yarns, fabrics or made up textile articles (heading 84.51).
(IV) ROASTING PLANT
This frequently consists of revolving cylindrical or spherical receptacles in which the products to be treated (e.g., coffee beans, cocoa beans, cereals or nuts) are subjected to controlled heat by contact with the heated walls of the containers, or by a direct stream of air forced through the heating medium (e.g., gas or oil burners or coke fires). These appliances usually incorporate devices which keep the products in constant rotation to ensure uniform treatment and to prevent charring. Other types take the form of perforated, inclined or rotating shelves in a chamber fed with heated gases.
The goods of this heading should not be confused with the industrial or laboratory furnaces and ovens of heading 84.17.
(V) STEAMING PLANT
This may be in the form of closed vessels (of the general type described earlier in this Explanatory Note) in which materials of various kinds may be subjected to humid heat (e.g., by steaming under pressure, or by the action of the vapours given off by the products themselves).
Such plant is used in various manufacturing operations (e.g., in the preparation of vegetable or animal extracts; in the food industry generally; in operations involving the use of steam for de greasing or cleansing processes). Other types consist of larger chambers for subjecting material to more or less prolonged action of an atmosphere of steam; these are used, for example, for conditioning textile fibres in the mass, for steam treatment of wood, etc.
The heading excludes machines for conditioning textile yarns or fabrics or for other steam treatment of such textiles (heading 84.51).
(VI) STERILISING APPARATUS
These consist essentially of receptacles or chambers, heated usually by steam or boiling water (or sometimes by hot air), in which the articles or materials to be sterilised are maintained for a period at a sufficiently high temperature to kill bacteria, etc., without alteration of the composition or physical condition of the articles or materials themselves.
Many sterilisers for liquids resemble the apparatus described in Part (I) above (e.g., pasteurisers). Some large types of sterilisers may be equipped with a conveyor on which the goods are carried through the heating medium and, if necessary, subsequently through a cooling apparatus which may also form part of the plant.
The group includes not only sterilisers for industrial use (e.g., for milk, wine, fruit juices, cotton wool) but also those for installation in operating theatres, etc.
(VII) MACHINERY FOR LIQUEFYING AIR;
SPECIAL LABORATORY APPARATUS AND EQUIPMENT
The heading includes machines of the Linde or Claude type used for the liquefaction of air.
The heading further includes specially designed laboratory apparatus and equipment, generally small in size (autoclaves, distilling, sterilising or steaming apparatus, dryers, etc.), but it excludes demonstrational apparatus of heading 90.23, and measuring, checking, etc., apparatus more specifically covered by Chapter 90.
PARTS
Subject to the general provisions regarding the classification of parts (see the General Explanatory Note to Section XVI), the heading covers parts of the above. Such parts include certain elements of distillation apparatus or rectifying columns, such as retorts, bubble caps and rings, plates and certain tube elements; revolving plates and drums, etc., for roasters or dryers.
Metal tubes and pipes which have been bent or curved but not otherwise worked, presented unassembled, are not identifiable as parts of goods of this heading and are therefore to be classified in Section XV."
19,8420,"84.20 Calendering or other rolling machines, other than for metals or glass, and cylinders therefor.
8420.10 Calendering or other rolling machines
- Parts :
8420.91 - Cylinders
8420.99 - Other
With the exception of metal-rolling or metal working machines of heading 84.55, 84.62 or 84.63 and of glass working machines of heading 84.75, this heading covers calendering or other rolling machines, whether specialised to a particular industry or not.
These machines consist essentially of two or more parallel cylinders or rollers revolving with their surfaces in more or less close contact so as to perform the following operations, either by pressure of the cylinders alone or by pressure combined with friction, heat or moisture :
(1) The rolling into sheet form of material (including bakery, confectionery, biscuit, etc., doughs, chocolate, rubber, etc.) fed to the rollers in a plastic condition.
(2) The production of certain effects on the surface of sheet materials (other than metal or glass) passed between the rollers, e.g., smoothing (including ironing), lustring, glazing, polishing, embossing or graining.
(3) The application of dressings or surface coatings.
(4) The bonding of fabrics.
Machines of this kind are employed in various industries (e.g., the paper, textile, leather, linoleum, plastics or rubber manufacturing industries).
In certain industries particular names are given to calendering machines (e.g., ironing machines in laundries, finishing mangles for the textile industry, or supercalenders for the paper industry), but they are classified in this heading whether called calendering machines or not.
Calendering machines frequently constitute subsidiary units of other machines (e.g., paper making machines). When the calendering machines are presented together with these other machines, classification is governed by Notes 3 and 4 to Section XVI.
On the other hand, calendering machines which merely incorporate auxiliary appliances, such as impregnating baths or rollers, winding or cutting devices, remain in this heading.
The heading also covers smoothing or ironing machines of the calender type, whether or not for domestic use.
PARTS
Subject to the general provisions regarding the classification of parts (see the General Explanatory Note to Section XVI), parts of the machines of this heading are also classified here. These include cylinders clearly identifiable as for use with calendering or rolling machines of this heading. These cylinders may be made of metal, wood or other suitable material (e.g., compressed paper). They may be of various lengths and diameters, may be solid or hollow and, depending on the particular purpose for which they are required, their surface may be polished, corrugated, grained, or may bear engraved patterns. They may also be covered with other materials (e.g., leather, textile fabric or rubber). Metal cylinders are usually so designed that they can be heated internally by means of steam, gas, etc. Sets of cylinders for a particular calendering machine may comprise cylinders of different composition.
This heading does not include machines which, though somewhat similar to calendering or rolling machines, do not fulfil the purposes described above, for example :
(a) Cylinder drying machines for textiles, paper, etc. (heading 84.19 or 84.51).
(b) Wine or cider presses, etc. (heading 84.35).
(c) Roller crushing or grinding machines (heading 84.36, 84.74 or 84.79).
(d) Cylinder machines for flour milling (heading 84.37).
(e) Laundry wringing machines (heading 84.51).

(II) Filtering or purifying machinery and apparatus for liquids or gases, other than, e.g., filter funnels, milk strainers, strainers for filtering paints (generally Chapter 73).
(I) CENTRIFUGES,
INCLUDING CENTRIFUGAL DRYERS
Most of these machines consist essentially of a perforated plate, drum, basket or bowl, etc., revolving at great speed in a stationary collector, usually cylindrical, against the walls of which the expelled materials are projected by centrifugal force. In some types the substances of different specific gravities are collected at different levels by means of a series of inverted separator cones. In other types the solid ingredients are retained in the perforated revolving drum, basket, etc., and the liquid ingredients expelled. Machines of this latter type may also be used to force liquids to penetrate thoroughly into materials (e.g., in dyeing or cleaning).
The heading includes :
(1) Centrifugal driers for laundries, dyeworks, pulp mills, flour mills, etc.
(2) Sugar refining centrifuges.
(3) Cream separators and centrifugal clarifiers for milk.

PARTS
Subject to the general provisions regarding the classification of parts (see the General Explanatory Note to Section XVI), parts of centrifuges are also classified here (e.g., plates, drums, baskets, bowls and collectors).
The heading excludes certain other types of machines operating on the centrifugal principle, e.g. :
(a) Special centrifuges, called “gas” centrifuges, for the separation of uranium isotopes (heading 84.01).
(b) Centrifugal pumps for liquids (heading 84.13).

(f) Centrifugal grinding machines (heading 84.74).
(g) Centrifugal spin dryers for semiconductor wafer manufacturing (heading 84.86).
(II) FILTERING OR PURIFYING MACHINERY AND APPARATUS,
FOR LIQUIDS OR GASES
Much of the filtration or purification plant of this heading is purely static equipment with no moving parts. The heading covers filters and purifiers of all types (physical or mechanical, chemical, magnetic, electro-magnetic, electrostatic, etc.). The heading covers not only large industrial plant, but also filters for internal combustion engines and small domestic appliances. The heading does not, however, include filter funnels, milk strainers, vessels, tanks, etc., simply equipped with metallic gauze or other straining material, nor general purpose vessels, tanks, etc., even if intended for use as filters after insertion of a layer of gravel, sand, charcoal, etc.
In general, filtering machinery and plant of this heading is of two distinct types according to whether it is intended for liquids or gases.
(A) Filtering and purifying machinery, etc., for liquids, including water softeners.
The liquid filters of this group separate solid, fatty, colloidal, etc., particles from a liquid, for example, by passing it through a sheet, membrane or mass of porous material (e.g., cloth, felt, wire cloth, skin, stoneware, porcelain, kieselguhr, sintered metallic powders, asbestos, paper pulp, cellulose, charcoal, animal black, sand). In the treatment of drinking water, some of these materials (e.g., porcelain and charcoal) remove bacteria, etc., in the process of filtration; filters using these materials are therefore sometimes called “water purifiers”. Filters are also used to eliminate liquids from materials in the form of a slurry (e.g., from ceramic materials or ore concentrates). The heading covers liquid filters whether of the gravity, suction (or vacuum) or pressure types.
It includes, inter alia :
(1) Domestic type water filters. Pressure type domestic filters are designed for fitting to the mains pipes or to the tap, and usually consist of a cylindrical ceramic filtering element enclosed in a metal container. Gravity types are similar but often larger. But the heading excludes filters made mainly of ceramics or glass (Chapter 69 or 70, respectively).
(2) Filter candles for man-made textile manufacture. These consist of a non-corrosive container housing a textile element which filters the spinning solution.
(3) Oil filters for internal combustion engines, machine tools, etc. They are of two main types :
(i) Those containing a filtering element, usually of superimposed layers of felt, metallic gauze, steel wool, etc.
(ii) Those containing permanent magnets or electromagnets for the extraction of ferrous particles from the oil.
(4) Filters for boiler water. These usually consist of a large vessel fitted internally with several superimposed layers of filtering materials and, in addition to the inlet and outlet tubes, a system of pipes and valves for cleaning the filtering elements by a cross-current of water.
(5) Filter presses. These consist of a horizontal series of filtering chambers formed by readily detachable vertical filter plates and frames; these are covered by a filtering medium (cloth, cellulose, etc.), and are held in place by a screw or press mechanism. The liquid is forced through the cells by a pump, and the chambers may be heated internally by steam, etc. The filtrate is drawn from the press and the residue collects in cakes between the plates. Filter presses are used for filtering or clarifying many liquids (e.g., in the chemical industry, the sugar industry, in brewing, wine making, oil purification, ore concentration, in the manufacture of ceramics, man made textiles, etc.).
(6) Rotary drum vacuum filters. These comprise a cylinder covered with filter cloth or gauze and mounted in the tank containing the liquid to be filtered. The liquid is sucked into the drum, and mechanical devices remove the solid residue from the periphery.
(7) Intermittent vacuum filters. These consist of a number of “leaves” or chambers each covered with filter cloth and connected to a common vacuum line. The filter is submerged in the feed tank and the vacuum applied.
(8) Chemical water purifiers, e.g., permutite or zeolite softeners and lime water purifiers.
(9) Electro-magnetic water purifiers. In these purifiers the action of an alternating magnetic field prevents the calcareous salts in the water from crystallising and forming deposits on the walls of the tubes; instead, the salts separate as sludges which can readily be removed.
The heading also covers dialysers, special type filters consisting essentially of a semi-permeable membrane through which liquids can pass by diffusion and thus be separated from colloidal particles.
(B) Filtering or purifying machinery, etc., for gases
These gas filters and purifiers are used to separate solid or liquid particles from gases, either to recover products of value (e.g., coal dust, metallic particles, etc., recovered from furnace flue gases), or to eliminate harmful materials (e.g., dust extraction, removal of tar, etc., from gases or smoke fumes, removal of oil from steam engine vapours).
They include :
(1) Filters and purifiers acting solely by mechanical or physical means; these are of two types. In the first type, as in liquid filters, the separating element consists of a porous surface or mass (felt, cloth, metallic sponge, glass wool, etc.). In the second type, separation is achieved by suddenly reducing the speed of the particles drawn along with the gas, so that they can then be collected by gravity, trapped on an oiled surface, etc. Filters of these types often incorporate fans or water sprays.
Filters of the first type include :
(i) Intake air filters for internal combustion engines. These often combine the two systems described above.
(ii) Bag filters. These consist of a series of bag shaped cloth filtering elements, and often incorporate a shaker mechanism to cause the trapped particles to fall through the bottom of the bags.
(iii) Screen filters. These consist of an endless filtering gauze running on two rollers and stretched across the chamber through which the gases are passed. The screen is cleaned by a scraper mechanism.
(iv) Rotary drum filters, e.g., as used in sand blasting plant. They usually consist of a filter drum into which the air is drawn by suction. The drum revolves against a scraper which frees the drum of the residue.
Filters of the second type include :
(v) Dust extractors, smoke filters, etc., fitted with various types of obstructing elements to reduce the speed of the particles in the gas stream, e.g., baffle plates, partitions perforated with non-corresponding orifices, circular or spiral circuits fitted with baffles, and cones of superimposed baffle rings.
(vi) Cyclones, usually consisting essentially of sheet metal cones enclosed in a cylindrical tank. The gases are fed into the narrower part of the cone by a tangential pipe and the turbulent currents thus set up decrease sharply as the gases approach the broader section of the cone, so that the dust falls to the bottom of the tank.
(2) Electrostatic filters for air or other gases in which the essential element is usually a series of vertical wires charged with static electricity. The dust in the air passing through the apparatus is attracted to and retained on the wires from which it is removed periodically.
(3) Gas scrubbers or absorption towers. These are used for purifying producer gas, coal gas, etc.; they consist of tall metal columns containing coke or other fillings, and fitted at the top with water sprays.
(4) Other chemical filters and purifiers for air or other gases (including catalytic converters which change carbon monoxide in the exhaust gases of motor vehicles).
This group also includes the following machinery employed in the nuclear industry : air filters specially designed to eliminate radioactive dust (physical or electrostatic types); active-charcoal purifiers for retaining radioactive iodine; ion-exchange apparatus for the separation of radioactive elements, including such apparatus operating by electrodialysis; separators for irradiated fuels or for processing effluents, whether operating by ion-exchange or operating chemically (by means of solvents, precipitation, etc.).

Leaves for intermittent vacuum filters; chassis, frames and plates for filter presses; rotary drums for liquid or gas filters; baffles and perforated plates, for gas filters.
It should be noted, however, that filter blocks of paper pulp fall in heading 48.12 and that many other filtering elements (ceramics, textiles, felts, etc.) are classified according to their constituent material.
The heading also excludes :
(a) Gas diffusion apparatus for the separation of uranium isotopes (heading 84.01).
(b) Air conditioning machines of heading 84.15 or air de humidifiers of heading 84.79.

Machines which in addition to packing, wrapping, etc., also perform other operations remain classified in the heading provided the additional operations are incidental to the packing, etc. Thus machines which pack or wrap goods into the forms or presentations in which they are normally distributed and sold in commerce, are classified in this heading, whether or not the machines also contain devices for weighing or measuring. Similarly the heading includes machines incorporating devices which, as a secondary function, cut, mould or press previously prepared products into purely presentational forms without affecting their essential character (e.g., machines for moulding butter or margarine into blocks, etc., and wrapping them). The heading does not, however, cover machines whose primary function is not to pack, wrap, etc., but to manufacture raw or semi finished materials into finished products (e.g., combined cigarette making and packaging machines).
PARTS
Subject to the general provisions regarding the classification of parts (see the General Explanatory Note to Section XVI), the heading also covers parts of the above mentioned machinery. It should be noted, however, that in the case of composite machines, parts of any component machine which would not on its own fall in this heading, are classified in their own appropriate headings, e.g., parts of weighing machines (heading 84.23), of carton or paper bag making machines (heading 84.41) or of printing machines (heading 84.43).
The heading excludes :

This heading covers simple lifting or handling equipment. The provisions of Explanatory Note to heading 84.26 apply, mutatis mutandis, to the equipment of this heading insofar as they concern self propelled and other “mobile” machines, multi-function machines and lifting, loading, handling, etc., machines intended for incorporation in other machines or for mounting on transport vehicles or vessels of Section XVII. However, if a winch is the normal working tool of a tractor, the complete machine (tractor and winch) is classifiable in heading 87.01.
The heading covers :
(Ⅰ) PULLEY TACKLE AND HOISTS
OTHER THAN SKIP HOISTS
The pulley tackle and hoists classified in this heading consist of more or less complex systems of pulleys and cables, chains, ropework, etc., designed to give a mechanical advantage to facilitate lifting (e.g., by use of pulleys of different diameter, toothed wheels, gearing systems).
This group includes, inter alia :
(1) Tackle and hoists in which the chain engages in specially designed projections on the pulley rims.
(2) Drum type pulley hoists in which the cable is wound on a drum enclosing the pulley mechanism. This self contained type of hoist, usually pneumatic or electric, is often mounted on a trolley or crab running on an overhead rail.
(3) Hoists consisting of a roller chain running over a geared system of sprocket wheels operated by a crank handle or lever, somewhat as in a jacking system.
Separately presented pulleys and pulley blocks are excluded (heading 84.83).
Davits, also included in this heading, consist of twin tipping or swivelling supports from which ships’ boats, etc., may be raised or lowered by means of pulley tackle type hoisting gear.
(II) WINCHES AND CAPSTANS
Winches consist of hand-operated or power-driven horizontal ratchet drums around which the cable is wound. Capstans are similar, but the drum is vertical.
This group includes :
(1) Marine winches and capstans for operating cargo lifting gear, raising anchor, manoeuvring the steering gear, hauling in tow lines, fishing nets, dredging cables, etc. The power unit is often built into those machines as an integral whole.
(2) Winches for tractors, etc.
(3) Pit head winding gear, consisting essentially of a large power driven winch.
(4) Capstans for operating turn tables, or for shunting railway wagons, etc. For shunting, the cable is usually passed along a number of bollards each freely turning on bearings to facilitate haulage. These bollards are classified in heading 73.25 or 73.26.
(5) Drawing blocks for wire-drawing benches.
(III) JACKS
Jacks are designed to raise heavy loads through short distances. The heading includes rack and pawl jacks, screw jacks in which the screw is raised by rotation or by rotating a nut fixed in the jack base, and telescopic screw jacks operated by the action of two or more concentric screws, the outer screw turning in the nut in the jack base.
In hydraulic or pneumatic jacks, the lifting piston is forced along a cylinder by pressure generated in a pump or compressor which may be separate or built in.
Special types of jacks include :

The heading covers a number of intermittent action lifting or handling machines.
SELF PROPELLED AND OTHER “MOBILE” MACHINES
In general, the heading covers not only fixed or stationary machines, but (with certain exceptions referred to below concerning machines mounted on transport equipment of the type falling in Section XVII) also mobile machines, whether or not self propelled.
The exceptions are :
(a) Machines mounted on vehicles proper to Chapter 86.
Lifting or handling machines are classified in heading 86.04 if they are mounted on wagons or trucks, of a kind suitable for coupling to a train designed to run on a railway network of any gauge. Railway breakdown cranes or crane wagons or trucks for servicing the permanent way or rolling stock, and crane wagons or trucks for use in railroad goods loading depots, usually comply with this condition. Self-propelled vehicles for the servicing and maintenance of railway tracks fall also in heading 86.04. On the other hand, lifting or handling machines mounted on trucks or platforms not meeting the specifications of true railway rolling stock remain classified in this heading. This is usually the case, for example, with contractors’ cranes mounted to run on rails in servicing building sites, quarries, etc.
(b) Machines mounted on tractors or motor vehicles proper to Chapter 87.
(1) Machines mounted on tractor type bases.
Certain working parts of the machines of this heading may be mounted on tractors which are constructed essentially for hauling or pushing another vehicle, appliance or load but, like agricultural tractors, are fitted with simple devices for operating the working tools. Such working tools are subsidiary equipment for occasional work. In general, they are relatively light and can be mounted or changed at the working site by the user himself. In such cases, the working tools remain in this heading provided they constitute machines of this heading, or in heading 84.31 if they are parts of those machines, even if presented with the tractor (whether or not mounted thereon), while the tractor with its operating equipment is classified separately in heading 87.01.
On the other hand, this heading covers self-propelled machines in which the propelling base, the operating controls, the working tools and their actuating equipment are specially designed for fitting together to form an integral mechanical unit. This applies, for example, to a propelling base resembling a tractor, but specially designed, constructed or reinforced to form an integral part of a machine performing one or more of the functions mentioned in this heading (lifting, handling, etc.). Presented separately, such propelling bases also fall in this heading, as incomplete machines having the essential features of complete machines of the same kind. Propelling bases potentially classifiable in several of the headings 84.25 to 84.30 because they can be equipped with several different working parts, are classified in accordance with Note 3 to Section XVI or by application of Interpretative Rule 3 (c).
For more detailed criteria for distinguishing between the tractors of heading 87.01 and the propelling bases of this Chapter, see Explanatory Note to heading 87.01.
(2) Machines mounted on automobile chassis or lorries.
Certain lifting or handling machines (e.g., ordinary cranes, light breakdown cranes) are often mounted on what is in fact an essentially complete automobile chassis or lorry in that it comprises at least the following mechanical features : propelling engine, gear box and controls for gear-changing, and steering and braking facilities. Such assemblies fall to be classified in heading 87.05 as special purpose motor vehicles, whether the lifting or handling machine is simply mounted on the vehicle or forms an integral mechanical unit with it, unless they are vehicles designed essentially for transport purposes falling in heading 87.04.
On the other hand, this heading includes self-propelled machines in which one or more of the propelling or control elements referred to above are located in the cab of a lifting or handling machine (generally a crane) mounted on a wheeled chassis, whether or not the whole can be driven on the road under its own power.
The cranes of this heading do not generally move under load or, if they do, the movement is limited and subsidiary to their main function of lifting.
(c) Machines on floating structures proper to Chapter 89.
All lifting or handling machines (e.g. derricks and cranes) mounted on pontoons or other floating structures, whether or not self propelled, are classified in Chapter 89.
MULTI-FUNCTION MACHINES
Many machines, in addition to carrying out the functions described in this heading or heading 84.25, 84.27 or 84.28 (lifting, loading, etc.) can also perform the functions described in heading 84.29 or 84.30 (excavating, levelling, boring, etc.). These machines are classified in accordance with Note 3 to Section XVI or by application of Interpretative Rule 3 (c). Examples are mechanical shovels, draglines, etc., which by interchanging jibs or end attachments can be used as cranes, combined coal-cutting and loading machines, combined trenching and pipe lifting and lowering machines, etc.
Lifting, loading, handling, etc., machines presented separately are, however, classified in this heading even if intended for incorporation in other machines or for mounting on transport vehicles or vessels of Section XVII.
The heading covers lifting or handling machines usually based on pulley, winch or jacking systems, and often including large proportions of static structural steelwork, etc.
These static structural elements (e.g., crane pedestals and gantries) are classified in this heading when they are presented as parts of a more or less complete handling machine.
When presented separately, they are classified in heading 84.31 provided they are fitted or designed to be fitted with the mechanical features essential for the operation of the moving parts of the complete installation (wheels, rollers, pulleys, running or guide rails, etc.). Otherwise these structural elements are classified in heading 73.08.
The heading covers :
(1) Bridge cranes, which consist of a powerful lifting unit suspended from a heavy cross beam or “bridge”, the whole moving on wide gauge rails. Similar bridge cranes used in nuclear reactors for changing or extracting the fuel elements are also classified here.
(2) Gantry cranes and overhead travelling cranes in which the beam itself runs on rails fixed on walls or on suitable supporting metal structures.
(3) Transporter cranes, fixed or running on rails. These are sometimes very long and normally have a cantilever extension (which may or may not be articulated) over berths or unloading areas and are equipped with a hoisting trolley or crab running along the whole length of the beam. Special types are used for handling blocks of building stone or containers and in shipbuilding.
(4) Mobile lifting frames on tyred wheels, particularly for container handling. These machines may be self-propelled, provided they are designed to operate when stationary or, if they are able to move with their load over short distances, that they are simple portals which in most cases consist of a horizontal beam supported by two vertical members (sometimes of the telescopic type), each resting on a set of wheels.
(5) Straddle carriers, which consist of a chassis of the “straddle” type, generally with vertical telescopic members for adjusting the height. This chassis is normally mounted on four or more tyred wheels which usually serve both as driving and steering wheels so as to permit manoeuvres within a very small radius.
Owing to their special design they are able to position themselves over a load, lift it by means of special gripping devices, transport it over short distances and then lower it again. Some of these carriers are sufficiently wide and high to be positioned directly over transport vehicles for lifting or lowering the load.
Straddle carriers are used in factories, warehouses, dock areas, airports, etc., for handling long loads (profile shapes, tree trunks, timber, etc.) or for stacking containers.
(6) Tower cranes. These cranes comprise essentially a tower, usually composed of individual sections, of considerable height, fixed or running on rail, a main horizontal jib, fitted with trolleys, winches, service platforms and a cab for the operator, a counterweight jib with counterweights, tie bars to support the jibs, and a slewing device, either at the top or at the bottom, to enable the crane to rotate. The tower may contain hydraulic cylinders or jacks and a climbing frame which raise the jib so that additional tower sections can be attached to increase the working height of the crane.
(7) Portal or pedestal cranes, as used in harbours, which are jib cranes supported on tall four legged pedestals which run on rails of such wide gauge as to span one or more normal railway tracks.
(8) Jib or derrick cranes (but see the introduction to this Explanatory Note regarding railway breakdown cranes, crane lorries, floating cranes, etc.). Jib or derrick cranes are used for lifting loads and sometimes also moving them laterally. They consist essentially of a boom or jib which may be jointed to provide adjustable reach and to facilitate working. The hoisting cable passes over pulleys at the top of the boom and is driven by a winch. The jib or boom may be supported by a vertical support, sometimes of considerable height.
(9) Cableways and cable cranes, which are installations for transporting suspended loads. They consist of one or more bearer cables supported on fixed or movable towers, and a trolley running on the cables and fitted with a mechanism for hoisting and lowering the loads. They are used for handling materials on large construction sites, dams, bridges, quarries, etc.
(10) Ships’ derricks, which consist of a fixed upright arm, to the base of which is pivoted a load carrying arm which can be raised by a pulley system. (See the introduction to this Explanatory Note regarding similar machines mounted on floating pontoons, etc.)
(11) Works trucks fitted with a crane, which are designed for moving loads over short distances in factories, warehouses, dock areas or airports by means of a light crane mounted on a chassis of the works truck type, usually in the form of a box frame, with a long wheel base and a wide track to avoid overbalancing.

8427.10 Self propelled trucks powered by an electric motor
8427.20 Other self-propelled trucks
8427.90 Other trucks
With the exception of straddle carriers and works trucks fitted with a crane of heading 84.26, this heading covers works trucks fitted with lifting or handling equipment.
Works trucks of this description include, for example :
(A) FORK-LIFT AND
OTHER ELEVATING OR STACKING TRUCKS
(1) Mechanically propelled fork-lift trucks, which are sometimes of large size, carry the load on an elevating carriage sliding on a vertical mast. This lifting mechanism is normally situated in front of the driver’s seat; it is designed to support the load during movement and to lift it for stacking or to place it on a vehicle.
This group also includes side loading stacking trucks, which are designed to handle long loads (girders, planks, pipes, containers, etc.) and are usually equipped with a platform to support the load during transport over short distances.
The lifting device of the above trucks is normally powered by the motive power unit of the vehicle, and is usually designed to be fitted with various special attachments (forks, jibs, buckets, grabs, etc.) according to the type of load to be handled.
(2) Other stacking machines, usually mounted on a truck, are equipped with a platform or fork which can be raised and lowered in a vertical support, by hand or power-operated winch or rack systems. They are used for stacking sacks, crates, casks, etc.
Some stacking machines which work on the same principle as elevators are classified in heading 84.28.
(B) OTHER WORKS TRUCKS
FITTED WITH LIFTING OR HANDLING EQUIPMENT
This group includes :
(1) Trucks with mechanically elevating platforms for the maintenance of electric cables, public lighting systems, etc. (See the introduction to Explanatory Note to heading 84.26 regarding elevating platforms of this type mounted on lorries.)
(2) Other trucks fitted with lifting or handling equipment including those specialised for use in particular industries (e.g., in the textile or ceramic industries, in dairies, etc.).
PARTS
Subject to the general provisions regarding the classification of parts (see the General Explanatory Note to Section XVI), parts of the trucks of this heading are classified in heading 84.31."
27,8428,"84.28 Other lifting, handling, loading or unloading machinery (for example, lifts, escalators, conveyors, teleferics).

8428.60 Teleferics, chair lifts, ski-draglines; traction mechanisms for funiculars
8428.70 Industrial robots
8428.90 Other machinery
With the exception of the lifting and handling machinery of headings 84.25 to 84.27, this heading covers a wide range of machinery for the mechanical handling of materials, goods, etc. (lifting, conveying, loading, unloading, etc.). They remain here even if specialised for a particular industry, for agriculture, metallurgy, etc. This heading is not limited to lifting or handling equipment for solid materials but also includes such machinery for liquids or gases. But the heading excludes liquid elevators of the type falling in heading 84.13, and floating docks, coffer dams and similar marine lifting and re floating appliances operating solely by hydrostatic buoyancy (heading 89.05 or 89.07).
The provisions of Explanatory Note to heading 84.26 apply, mutatis mutandis, to the equipment of this heading insofar as they concern self-propelled and other “mobile” machines, multi-function machines and lifting, loading, handling, etc., machines intended for incorporation in other machines or for mounting on transport vehicles or vessels of Section XVII.
The heading covers lifting or handling machines usually based on pulley, winch or jacking systems, and often including large proportions of static structural steelwork, etc.
These static structural elements (e.g., pylons specialised for teleferics, etc.) are classified in this heading when they are presented as parts of a more or less complete handling machine.
When presented separately, they are classified in heading 84.31 provided they are fitted or designed to be fitted with the mechanical features essential for the operation of the moving parts of the complete installation (wheels, rollers, pulleys, running or guide rails, etc.). Otherwise these structural elements are classified in heading 73.08.
These more complex machines include :
(I) INTERMITTENT ACTION MACHINES
(A) Lifts are usually operated by winch and cable, or by rams worked by water, air or oil. They are used for raising or lowering a passenger cage or goods platform between vertical guide bars, and are generally fitted with counter-balance weights. The control, stopping, safety, etc., equipment, whether or not electrical, is also classified in this heading provided it is presented with the lift itself. The heading also includes manually operated lifts.
Rack and pinion driven lifts or hoists also belong to this category. These lifts and hoists consist of a lift cage, fitted with a motor that drives a pinion, and a mast, equipped with a toothed rack. When the pinion is engaged with the toothed rack, it permits the lift cage to move along the mast, up or down, at a controlled speed.
The group also includes so-called “ship-lifts”, i.e., very powerful hydraulic or jack operated installations for lifting a vessel and lock basin complete from one canal level to another, and thus replacing normal locks.
(B) Skip hoists are a type of lift in which bulk material containers are hoisted up a ramp or vertical shaft. They are used for raising coal from mines, for hoisting ores, limestone, fuel, etc., into blast furnaces, lime kilns, etc.
The heading also includes skips for such skip hoists, i.e., large capacity metallic containers or bins often fitted with automatically opening bottoms. Mining skips usually incorporate a cabin for the miners mounted above the load bin.
(C) Certain lifting machines :
(1) Lifting gins consist of a winch mounted on a two legged or tripod support.
(2) Well drilling derricks for hoisting the drilling tubes, etc., in petroleum wells, etc. (other than those mounted on lorries, etc. - see the introduction to Explanatory Note to heading 84.26).
(3) Telphers are similar in operation to overhead travelling or transporter cranes. The hoisting trolleys run (sometimes for considerable distances) on overhead rails supported on pylons.
(D) Teleferics are large winch operated installations generally for lifting passengers or goods in the mountains. They consist of the bearer and traction cables supported on pylons, and two cabins (or grabs, containers, etc.) which ascend and descend on the bearer cable.
(E) Funiculars operate on the same principle as teleferics but the coaches run on rails. The heading in this case covers only the traction mechanism and winch; it excludes the coaches (heading 86.05) and the track (heading 73.02 or 86.08 according to type).
(F) Wagon tippers are platforms with guide rails or grooves, so that the wagon can be run into position, clamped and then emptied by tilting, tipping or rotating the whole machine by a jacking or other lifting system. The heading also includes wagon shaking machines used to facilitate the discharge of hopper type wagons.
(II) CONTINUOUS ACTION MACHINES
(A) Elevators used for raising a constant stream of goods or persons vertically or obliquely. They consist essentially of a series of carriers of various types, attached at intervals to a jointed mechanism which turns as a continuous chain. They include bucket lifts for pulverised or granular materials, platform elevators for crates, parcels, etc., finger-tray elevators for sacks, barrels, bales of straw, sheaves, etc., and continuous multiple-cage lifts for passengers, etc.
(B) Escalators and moving walkways.
(C) Conveyors are used for moving goods, usually in a horizontal direction, sometimes over very long distances (in mines, quarries, etc.). They include :
(1) Conveyors operated by continuously-moving carrying or pushing elements, e.g., bucket, tray or pan type conveyors; scraper or screw conveyors (in which the materials are forced along a trough by a push plate or worm respectively); band, belt, apron, slat, chain, etc., conveyors.
(2) Conveyors consisting of a train of motor-driven rollers (e.g., as used for feeding steel into cogging mills). The heading also covers roller conveyors, not power-driven, usually mounted on bearings (e.g., horizontal roller runways for manoeuvring crates, etc., and gravity roller conveyors), but it excludes similar equipment without rollers, e.g., straight, curved or spiral sliding chutes (heading 73.08, 73.25 or 73.26 according to type).
(3) Vibrator or shaker conveyors operated by vibratory or reciprocating movements of the trough supporting the goods.
(D) Pneumatic elevators and conveyors (e.g., pneumatic tube conveyors), in which small containers (for documents, small machined parts, etc.) or bulk materials (grain, straw, hay, sawdust, pulverised coal, etc.) are forced along a tube by an air current (including similar machines for transporting and cleaning grain).
(E) Roller supports (“castors”), similar to roller conveyors, consist of a number of tubular posts fixed in the factory floor. The top of each post consists of a roller running on bearings and pivoting freely in all directions, so that the set of “castors” provides a roller table system (e.g., for handling sheet metal in rolling mills).
(F) Cable-operated hauling or towing machines consist essentially of an endless cable or chain in continuous motion for hauling wagons (e.g., for colliery tubs and tip wagons), for towing barges, sledges, etc., for carrying passengers (ski-lifts), etc.
(III) OTHER SPECIAL LIFTING OR HANDLING MACHINER
(A) Locomotive or wagon traversers for transferring locomotives, trucks, etc., from one track to another.
(B) Wagon pushers of various kinds, e.g. :
(1) Appliances fixed between the rails, consisting essentially of two reciprocating power-driven pistons which engage on the axles and thus push the trucks forward.
(2) Hydraulic ram or piston type machines for pushing mining trucks into the pithead cages, etc.
(3) Self-propelled one-wheel machines running on one rail of the permanent way. They have to be supported by a walking operator in the same way as wheelbarrows, and are powered by small petrol engines. It should, however, be noted that small tractors, also sometimes known as “wagon pushers” and used for that purpose, are excluded (heading 87.01).
(C) Mechanical loaders for picking up coal, ores, excavated earth, pebbles, sand or other bulk materials. These machines are usually combined with a conveyor or an elevator (shaker type conveyor-loader, pick-up conveyor-loader, etc.).
(D) Auxiliary mechanical appliances for manipulating pneumatically, hydraulically or electrically operated hand tools (drills, hammers, etc.). These appliances help to support the tool or push it forward into the work, e.g., pneumatically operated tool supports and pushers; drilling rigs and carriages (“Jumbos”); mechanical “balancers” for suspending tools during working. But the heading excludes simple static supports, etc.
(E) Industrial robots specifically designed for lifting, handling, loading or unloading.
(F) Mechanical ladders consisting of sliding sections operated by a mechanism (e.g., pulley tackle or winch).
(G) Mechanically adjustable wheeled platforms (“dollies”) for mounting and manipulating cinematographic cameras.
(H) Mechanical remote control manipulators, for radioactive products, fixed or mobile, consisting of an arm outside the shielded cell, which is guided manually, and an arm inside the cell, which reproduces the operator’s movements. Transmission of the movements is by means of mechanical, hydraulic or pneumatic appliances or by electric pulses.
Manipulators used independently in the hand (like a hand tool) fall in heading 82.03, 82.04 or 82.05.
(IJ) Platforms, whether or not self-propelled, for the handling of containers or palettes used in airports for loading or unloading of aircraft. This equipment consists principally of an elevated platform supported by two diagonal cross members. It is provided with a moving belt to transport the cargo. This equipment is not intended to transport containers or palettes, even over short distances, but is positioned empty beside the aircraft and operates only from that position.
(K) Palletisers, electrically driven machines designed to align empty bottles automatically in regular rows (using powered or roller conveyors) and then to transfer them perfectly aligned onto a pallet for stacking layer upon layer. These palletisers, which do not fill, close, seal, label or band bottles, can stand alone or be incorporated in a processing line containing other machines which carry out such functions as filling or shrink wrapping.
(L) Patient lifts. These are devices with a supporting structure and a seat for the raising and lowering of seated persons, e.g., in a bathroom or onto a bed. The mobile seat is fixed to the supporting structure by means of ropes or chains.
(M) Stair lifts. These are lifting devices, fitted with a load platform, which are fixed to banisters, stairway walls or the stairs and are used to move disabled persons or wheelchairs with their occupant up or down stairs.
Lifting or handling devices are often used with furnaces, converters, rolling mills, etc., e.g., machines for inserting, handling or withdrawing the pieces being worked; for manipulating doors, covers, hearths, etc.; tipping or tilting machines. When these machines form independent units clearly distinct from the furnaces, etc., they are classified in this heading even if presented with the furnaces, etc. Examples include :
(1) Coke oven discharging machines running to and fro behind the row of ovens, and equipped with a mechanical piston which opens the doors and empties the retorts.
(2) Ram or piston operated charging machines for Siemens Martin converters, etc.
(3) Special lifting machines for raising the covers of metallurgical annealing or “soaking” pits, or for lifting out the ingots.
(4) Ingot, forging, etc., manipulators, tilters, etc.
(5) Machines used in certain types of furnaces for inserting or removing, by the action of cylinders fitted with rams or pistons, the objects being treated in the furnace.
It should, however, be noted that the heading excludes lifting or handling machines designed to be incorporated in furnaces, converters, etc., or to form a complete unit therewith, provided they are presented with the furnaces, etc. (see headings 84.17, 84.54, 84.55, etc.). When presented separately they remain in this heading.
It should be noted that mechanical stokers, mechanical grates and similar appliances are also excluded (heading 84.16).
PARTS
Subject to the general provisions regarding the classification of parts (see the General Explanatory Note to Section XVI), parts of the machines of this heading are classified in heading 84.31.
The heading also excludes :
(a) Liquid elevators of bucket, chain, screw, band or similar kinds (heading 84.13).
(b) Machinery for sorting, screening, separating or washing earth, stone, ores or other mineral substances in solid form (heading 84.74).

8429.59 Other
The heading covers a number of earth digging, excavating or compacting machines which are explicitly cited in the heading and which have in common the fact that they are all self-propelled.
The provisions of Explanatory Note to heading 84.30 relating to self-propelled and multi-function machines apply, mutatis mutandis, to the self-propelled machinery of this heading, which includes the following :
(A) Bulldozers and angledozers. These consist of a propelling base, often track-laying, with a large blade mounted in front, and forming an integral mechanical unit. They are used, in particular, for removing debris and for rough levelling. Certain types are designed mainly for grubbing or for land clearing.
(B) Graders and levellers. These are machines designed for earth levelling or smoothing (on flat surfaces or banks) by means of an adjustable grading blade, usually mounted within the wheel base.
(C) Scrapers. These incorporate a sharp cutting edge designed to slice off a layer of top soil which is then passed into the scraper body or discharged by a conveyor.
It should be noted that this heading covers only those scrapers in which the motor propulsion unit and the scraper form an integral mechanical unit, for example, track laying scrapers in which the scraper body incorporating the cutting edge is situated between the two tracks. This heading also includes articulated scrapers which consist of a motor propulsion unit (even with only a single axle) and a scraper proper equipped with a fixed blade or a mobile attachment with several blades.
(D) Tamping machines as used in road making, for packing rail-road ballast, etc. (but see paragraph (a) of the introduction to Explanatory Note to heading 84.30 regarding machines mounted on vehicles of Chapter 86).
(E) Self-propelled road rollers as used in road building or other public works (e.g., for levelling the ground or rolling the road surface).
These machines are fitted with heavy cast iron or steel cylinders of large diameter, smooth or studded with metal feet which press into the soil (“sheep’s-foot” rollers), or with wheels and heavy grade solid or pneumatic tyres.
(F) Mechanical shovels (boom, jib or cable type) which dig into the soil, above or below machine level, by means of an excavating bucket, grab, etc., operated either directly from the end of a boom or jib (shovel excavators, drag shovels, etc.) or, to increase the working range, on a cable or by means of a hydraulic jack suspended from the jib (draglines). In long range excavators (slackline draglines), the bucket is operated on a cable running between two movable structures set some distance apart.
(G) Multi-bucket excavators in which the digging buckets are fitted on endless chains or on rotating wheels. These machines often incorporate conveyors for discharging the excavated soil, and they are mounted on wheeled or track-laying chassis. Special models are designed for digging or cleaning out trenches, drainage channels, ditches for use in open-cast (open-pit) mines, etc.
(H) Self-propelled shovel loaders. These are wheeled or crawler machines with a front mounted bucket which pick up material through motion of the machine, transport and discharge it.
Some “shovel-loaders” are able to dig into the soil. This is achieved as the bucket, when in the horizontal position, is capable of being lowered below the level of the wheels or tracks.
(IJ) Loader-transporters used in mines. These machines, the main function of which is handling and not transport, are equipped with a front-mounted bucket which picks up bulk materials and discharges them into the body of the machine.
This heading also covers self-propelled shovel loaders having an articulated arm with a bucket, mounted on the rear.
PARTS
Subject to the general provisions regarding the classification of parts (see the General Explanatory Note to Section XVI), parts of the machines of this heading, in particular, working tools (blades, buckets, etc.), whether or not fitted with booms and pneumatic or hydraulic cylinders, suitable for mounting directly onto the propelling base, are classified in heading 84.31."

8430.50 Other machinery, self-propelled
- Other machinery, not self-propelled :
8430.61 Tamping or compacting machinery
8430.69 Other
This heading covers machinery, other than the self propelled machines of heading 84.29 and agricultural, horticultural or forestry machinery (heading 84.32), for “attacking” the earth’s crust (e.g., for cutting and breaking down rock, earth, coal, etc.; earth excavation, digging, drilling, etc.), or for preparing or compacting the terrain (e.g., scraping, levelling, grading, tamping or rolling). It also includes pile drivers, pile extractors, snow ploughs, and snow blowers.
SELF-PROPELLED AND OTHER “MOBILE” MACHINES
In general, the heading covers not only fixed or stationary machines, but (with certain exceptions referred to below concerning machines mounted on transport equipment of the type falling in Section XVII) also mobile machines, whether or not self-propelled.
The exceptions are :
(a) Machines mounted on vehicles proper to Chapter 86.
Excavating, etc., machines are classified in heading 86.04 if they are mounted on wagons or trucks, of a kind suitable for coupling into a train running on a railway network of any gauge. Railroad ballast excavator-screening machines are often mounted on wagons or trucks complying with this condition. On the other hand, excavating, etc., machines mounted on trucks or platforms not meeting the specifications of true railway rolling stock remain classified in this heading. Self-propelled vehicles for the servicing and maintenance of railway tracks also fall in heading 86.04.
(b) Machines mounted on tractors or motor vehicles proper to Chapter 87.
(1) Machines mounted on tractor type bases.
Certain working parts (e.g., levelling blades) of the machines of this heading may be mounted on tractors which are constructed essentially for hauling or pushing another vehicle, appliance or load but, like agricultural tractors, are fitted with simple devices for operating the working tools. Such working tools are subsidiary equipment for occasional work. In general, they are relatively light and can be mounted or changed at the working site by the user himself. In such cases, the working tools remain in this heading provided they constitute machines of this heading, or in heading 84.31 if they are parts of those machines, even if presented with the tractor (whether or not mounted thereon), while the tractor with its operating equipment is classified separately in heading 87.01.
On the other hand, this heading covers self propelled machines in which the propelling base, the operating controls, the working tools and their actuating equipment are specially designed for fitting together to form an integral mechanical unit. This applies, for example, to a propelling base resembling a tractor, but specially designed, constructed or reinforced to form an integral part of a machine performing one or more of the functions mentioned in this heading (excavating, levelling, etc.). Presented separately, such propelling bases also fall in this heading, as incomplete machines having the essential features of complete machines of the same kind. Propelling bases potentially classifiable in several of the headings 84.25 to 84.30 because they can be equipped with several different working parts, are classified in accordance with Note 3 to Section XVI or by application of Interpretative Rule 3 (c).
For more detailed criteria for distinguishing between the tractors of heading 87.01 and the propelling bases of this Chapter see Explanatory Note to heading 87.01.
(2) Machines mounted on automobile chassis or lorries.
Certain machines of this heading (e.g., pile drivers, oil well drilling machines) are often mounted on what is in fact an essentially complete automobile chassis or lorry in that it comprises at least the following mechanical features : propelling engine, gear-box and controls for gear-changing, and steering and braking facilities. Such assemblies are classified in heading 87.05 as special purpose motor vehicles.
On the other hand, this heading includes self-propelled machines in which one or more of the propelling or control elements referred to above are located in the cab of a machine mounted on a wheeled chassis, whether or not the whole can be driven on the road under its own power.
The heading further includes self-propelled wheeled machines in which the chassis and the working machine are specially designed for each other and form an integral mechanical unit. In this case, the machine is not simply mounted on an automobile chassis like the machines described in the first paragraph above, but is completely integrated with a chassis that cannot be used for other purposes and may incorporate the essential automobile features referred to above.
(c) Machines on floating structures proper to Chapter 89.
All machines (e.g., dredgers) mounted on pontoons or other floating structures, whether or not self propelled, are classified in Chapter 89.
MULTI-FUNCTION MACHINES
Many machines, in addition to carrying out the functions described in heading 84.29 or 84.30 (excavating, levelling, boring, etc.), can also perform the functions described in heading 84.25, 84.26, 84.27 or 84.28 (lifting, loading, etc.). These machines are classified in accordance with Note 3 to Section XVI or by application of Interpretative Rule 3 (c). Examples are combined coal-cutting and loading machines, combined trenching and pipe lifting and lowering machines, etc.
The heading includes :
(I) PILE-DRIVERS AND PILE EXTRACTORS
Pile drivers consist of a heavy hammer weight, usually operated in a tall vertical guiding framework. The weight is raised by mechanical power and then allowed to fall on to the head of the pile either under gravity (single-acting machines) or under power (double-acting hammers).
The heading also covers pile-extractors.
(II) SNOW-PLOUGHS AND SNOW-BLOWERS
Snow ploughs and snow blower vehicles of Section XVII with built in equipment are excluded. The heading, however, covers snow-ploughs designed to be pushed or pulled (blade types), e.g., those designed to be attached to lorries or tractors.
(III) EXTRACTING, CUTTING OR DRILLING MACHINERY
This is mainly used in mining, well-drilling, tunnelling, quarrying, clay cutting, etc.
(A) Coal or rock cutters for cutting or breaking down coal, ores, etc. They consist of a bar or disc fitted with picks, or, more often, of an endless cutting chain running round a metal jib which may be adjustable for level and angle of cut (universal cutters). They may be mounted on self-propelled wheeled or tracklaying chassis, and some (cutter loaders) may be very large, incorporating a number of cutting chains and a built-in conveyor for loading the cut material on to the face conveyor, tubs, etc.
(B) Tunnelling machinery. Tunnelling shields have smooth outer surfaces and sharp front cutting edges which are pushed forward into the soil by a hydraulic jacking system.
(C) Machines for boring drill holes in rock, coal, etc., and percussion type cutters in which the drill can be swung to make linear cuts. But the heading excludes such tools for working in the hand, pneumatic, hydraulic or with self-contained motor (heading 84.67).
(D) Well sinking or boring machines for the extraction of petroleum, natural gases, sulphur (Frasch process), etc., for raising strata samples in mining and oil well prospecting, for the sinking of artesian wells, etc. These machines are of two main types :
(1) Rotary well sinking machinery consisting essentially of a derrick fitted with pulley tackle, a hoist drum with transmission and control gear (draw work), a swivel and a rotary table or gear wheel.
The power-driven draw-work imparts a rotary movement to the drill pipes by means of the rotary table or gear-wheel, the drill pipes being suspended from the rotary swivel. The draw-work also raises and lowers the drill pipes, when required, by means of the pulley tackle.
(2) Percussion machines consisting of an eccentric-driven rocker beam, the see-saw action of which causes the bit to strike continually into the well floor.
It should be noted that this heading covers only drilling machines as such. Other quite distinct machines normally used therewith are excluded even if presented with the drilling machines, e.g., pumps and compressors to force mud, stone, etc., out of the drilling (heading 84.13 or 84.14).
Fixed platforms used for the discovery or exploitation of off shore deposits of oil or natural gas are also classified here. Floating or submersible platforms fall in heading 89.05.
(E) Augering machines, hand or power operated, for boring holes in the ground (e.g., for setting trees or fencing posts), but not including hand tools of Chapter 82.
(F) Hydraulic wedges consist of a long barrel with a number of pistons set laterally at intervals along the length. They are placed in a fissure or drill hole and the pistons are forced out by pumping water into the barrel, thus breaking down the rock or coal.
(G) Ploughs, strippers, etc., consist of cutter blades, ploughs, picks, wedges, etc., which are forced along the face, slicing off the coal, clay, etc., and loading it directly on to face conveyors, etc.
(IV) TAMPING OR COMPACTING MACHINES
This group includes :
(A) Road rollers designed to be pushed or towed. This group includes “sheep’s-foot” tamping rollers studded with metal feet which press into the soil, and tamping rollers made up of a series of lorry type wheels with heavy grade pneumatic tyres mounted on a common axle.
However, the heading excludes self-propelled road rollers, whether or not fitted with “sheep’s-feet” or with solid or pneumatic tyres (heading 84.29) and agricultural rollers (heading 84.32).
(B) Tamping machines as used in road making, for packing rail-road ballast, etc., not self-propelled. Tools for working in the hand, pneumatic, hydraulic or with self-contained motor, are, however, excluded (heading 84.67).
(C) Machines, usually pneumatic, for compacting the sides of embankments, etc.
(V) EARTH EXCAVATING, SCRAPING OR LEVELLING MACHINERY
This group includes :
(A) Digging or excavating machines described in Explanatory Note to heading 84.29, not self-propelled.
(B) Dredgers (bucket or shovel type), similar to the multibucket excavators of heading 84.29.
Floating dredgers are excluded (heading 89.05).
(C) Railroad ballast excavator-screening machines, consisting essentially of a continuous chain of buckets which dig the ballast from under the railway tracks. They also incorporate mechanisms for screening and discharging the ballast. But see paragraph (a) at the beginning of this Explanatory Note regarding machines mounted on vehicles of Chapter 86.
(D) Rippers, rooters and scarifiers fitted with cutting teeth which loosen the top soil, break up old road surfaces, etc., prior to re-laying.
(E) Skimmers, a type of excavating shovel similar to those of heading 84.29 with a horizontal boom; used for “skimming” off the top soil.
PARTS
Subject to the general provisions regarding the classification of parts (see the General Explanatory Note to Section XVI), parts of the machines of this heading are classified in heading 84.31.
The heading also excludes :
(a) Hydraulic guns designed for dislodging minerals (e.g., gold bearing sands) from hill sides, etc., by projecting powerful water jets (heading 84.24).
(b) Agricultural rollers, consisting of a relatively long light land roller of small diameter, in some cases propelled by a small internal combustion engine (heading 84.32).

8432.90 Parts
This heading covers machines, whatever their mode of traction, used in place of hand tools, for one or more of the following classes of agricultural, horticultural or forestry work, viz. :
(I) Preparing the soil for cultivation (clearing, breaking, tilling, ploughing, loosening, etc.).
(II) Spreading or distributing fertilisers, including manure, or other products to improve the soil.
(III) Planting or sowing.
(IV) The working or maintenance of the soil during the growing period (hoeing, weeding, cleaning etc.).
The machines of this heading may be hauled by an animal or by a vehicle (e.g., a tractor), or may be mounted on a vehicle (e.g., on a tractor or a horse-drawn chassis). (In this context, “tractor” includes “single axle tractor”.)
Machines designed to be hauled by, or mounted as interchangeable equipment on a tractor.
Some agricultural, horticultural or forestry machines (for example, ploughs and harrows) are designed solely to be hauled or pushed by a tractor, to which they are linked by a coupling device (whether or not with a lifting mechanism). Others (e.g., rotating hoes) are operated by a general-purpose power take-off on the tractor. Such machines are mounted and changed in the fields, the forest or the farm yard. All these machines remain in this heading even if they are presented with (and whether or not mounted on) the tractor. The tractor itself is classified separately in heading 87.01.
The same classification principle applies where another type of hauling device is substituted for the tractor (e.g., one classified in heading 87.04), or where a rotary hoe is mounted on the driving axle of a single axle tractor in place of the wheels, so that it acts both as an implement and as driving wheels carrying the whole.
Self-propelled agricultural, horticultural or forestry machines.
In these machines the tractive part and the machine make up one integral unit (e.g., motorised ploughs). Such machines are classified in this heading.
However, the heading excludes fertiliser, etc., spreading lorries which are classified with other special purpose motor vehicles in heading 87.05.
The smaller types of agricultural machines designed to be drawn or rolled by manual power (e.g., ploughs, harrows, cultivators, hoes, rollers and seeders) also fall in this heading.
The numerous machines of this heading include :
(1) Ploughs for all soil working purposes, e.g., mouldboard ploughs (single or multi share or reversible types), sub-soil ploughs (usually without mouldboards) and disc ploughs.
(2) Harrows which are mainly used for breaking up the soil after ploughing. In the toothed harrow the teeth are fitted to a rigid, articulated or chain-mesh framework, or sometimes to a drum or rollers. In disc harrows the teeth are replaced by one or more rows of concave discs with cutting edges.
(3) Scarifiers, cultivators, weeders and hoes which are used for working, weeding or smoothing the soil after ploughing, or during the growth of the crops. These machines usually consist of a horizontal frame fitted with several rows of various types of tools (shares, discs, teeth, etc.), which may be rigid or springy, fixed or movable, and are sometimes interchangeable.
(4) Seeders, planters and transplanters, for seed, bulbs, tubers, plants, etc., consisting of a box, hopper or other reservoir, sometimes mounted on wheels, and equipped with devices for distribution and for opening and usually re-covering the furrow.
This group includes no-till direct seeders, planters and transplanters for sowing crops without preparing the soil through tillage. They deliver seed in a measured quantity and deposit the seed into the unprepared soil by penetrating through surface mulch and plant residues, opening a narrow slot or punching a hole into soils and releasing the seed at a predetermined position and depth.
(5) Fertiliser distributors and manure spreaders. Distributors for spreading manure or solid fertilisers (chemicals, dung, etc.), sometimes mounted on wheels, usually consist of containers fitted with a distributing mechanism such as sliding floor plates, a worm feed, endless chains or centrifugal discs; portable mechanical apparatus used for the same purposes are also included here.
Fertiliser distributors evenly spread synthetic fertilizer or other synthetic solid inputs over the soil. Manure spreaders distribute manure (dung) or a recycling of plant nutrients from “animal waste” over a field.
Moving-floor trailers with a chopper/distributor attachment enabling them to operate, while unloading, as muck spreaders, and slurry spreaders consisting of a wheeled container, usually equipped with spreading plates or troughs, fall in heading 87.16.
Portable injectors for forcing fertilising liquids into the soil, also fall in this heading. They consist of a long hollow rod, through which the fertiliser is pumped into the soil by a pump.
(6) Machines for clearing scrub, undergrowth, stalks of former crops, roots, etc. They generally consist of two large wheels and a drum fitted with cutting blades.
(7) Stone removing machines, similar to a harrow but fitted with hooked teeth in two rows converging towards an openslatted container, to collect stones.
(8) Rollers, mainly used to pack the soil. These include smooth, corrugated, disc, packer wheel, etc., rollers. The heading also includes rollers for gardens, lawns, sports-grounds, grass tracks, etc.
(9) Thinning out machines (e.g., beet separators) used for separating young plants. These may be very complex machines controlled by photo-electric devices.
(10) Machines for cutting back the tops or stalks of plants for pruning excess growth.

(21) Machines for removing leaves from the maize (corn) cobs; maize (corn) threshers.
This heading also covers lawn mowers, known as riding lawn mowers, consisting of three or four wheeled basic machines fitted with a driving seat and having a permanently attached cutter, i.e., one which is removed only for repair or maintenance. Since their principal function is the mowing of lawns, they remain in this heading even if they have a coupling device for hauling or pushing light attachments such as a trailer.
However, the heading excludes portable machines for trimming lawns, cutting grass along walls, borders or under bushes, for example. These machines, which are composed of a self-contained internal combustion engine in a light metal frame, or of an electric motor mounted on a metal handle, and a cutting device usually consisting of one or more thin nylon threads, are classified in heading 84.67.
(B) MACHINES FOR CLEANING, SORTING OR GRADING EGGS,
FRUIT OR OTHER AGRICULTURAL PRODUCE
The heading also covers machines, whether of horticultural, agricultural or industrial types, used for cleaning, sorting or grading produce, such as eggs, fruit, potatoes, onions, bulbs, carrots, asparagus and gherkins, according to size, shape, weight, etc. They remain classified in the heading whether or not they are electrically operated (e.g., photoelectric testers and graders), and they may be equipped with auxiliary devices (e.g., for testing eggs or for marking the produce).
Machines for cleaning, sorting or grading seed, grain or dried leguminous vegetables are excluded (heading 84.37).
Certain machines of the type falling in this heading (e.g., harvesters, combines, threshers, pick-up balers, baling presses, grading machines) often incorporate subsidiary lifting, handling, conveying, etc., apparatus (e.g., conveyor belts, sheaf and straw hoists and bucket-chains); these are classified with the machine, provided they are presented therewith; when presented separately they fall in heading 84.28.

33,8434,"84.34 Milking machines and dairy machinery.
8434.10 Milking machines
8434.20 Dairy machinery
8434.90 Parts
This heading covers mechanical milking machines, and other machinery, whether for farm or industrial purposes, used in the treatment of milk or for converting it into other dairy products.
(I) MILKING MACHINES
A milking machine comprises a cluster of teat-cups (each with a rubber liner) which are connected, by means of flexible tubing, on one side to a vacuum pump unit via a pulsator and on the other to a milk pail (usually of stainless metal). The pulsator, which is fixed to the lid of the milk pail, acts on the teat-cups by alternating atmospheric pressure with a comparative vacuum between the cups and the liners. The assembly formed by the teat-cup cluster, the pulsator and the milk pail is described as a “milking pail”.
In certain machines of smaller capacity, the milking pails and the vacuum pump unit may be on a common base (single or twin-pail machines).
In the machines of larger capacity, the various components are usually separate. A variable number of milking pails may be connected to the vacuum pump unit by piping. Certain types have no milk pails, the milk passing directly from the teat cups to the cooling apparatus or storage tanks along a pipe-line, generally fixed. These types include milking robots, also known as voluntary milking systems. These systems, which incorporate all the equipment necessary for automatic milking, inter alia, a nimble robotic arm, electronic devices, a vacuum pump, a compressor, a washing machine, milk meters, etc., are designed for milking cows at their own initiative. Each cow wears a collar carrying a transponder that identifies it, so that the system can decide whether the animal is due to be milked. The milking is performed by a robotic arm fitted with a laser-assisted vision system that permits the milk extraction devices to be guided directly to the teats of the cow.
When presented together, the various components of such machines are classified in this heading as constituting a functional unit within the meaning of Note 4 to Section XVI (see the General Explanatory Note to that Section). However, apparatus and appliances which do not contribute directly to the milking function (filters, cooling devices, storage tanks, apparatus for cleaning the teat cups and pipe lines, etc.) are not classified in this heading but in their appropriate headings.
(II) MACHINES FOR PROCESSING MILK
This group includes homogenisers. These break up the fat into fine particles which are more readily digestible, and which also remain longer in a state of emulsion without the formation of cream.
The majority of machines for processing milk depend essentially on the principle of heat exchange and are therefore excluded (heading 84.19), e.g., apparatus for pasteurisation, stassanisation or sterilisation; apparatus for condensing or drying milk; milk coolers.
The heading further excludes :
(a) Refrigerating appliances (whether or not specially designed for cooling or keeping milk) and milk cooling vats, incorporating an evaporator of a refrigerating unit (heading 84.18).
(b) Cream separators, filter-presses and other filtering or clarifying machinery or apparatus (heading 84.21). (Simple filter funnels and milk strainers are, however, classified according to the constituent material.)
(c) Machines for washing milk containers, and milk bottling or canning machines (heading 84.22).
(III) MACHINERY FOR CONVERTING MILK
INTO OTHER DAIRY PRODUCTS
It should be noted that cream separators are excluded (heading 84.21). The heading does, however, cover machines, used for the manufacture of butter or cheese. They include :
(A) Butter-making machines.
(1) Churns usually consist of a barrel of stainless steel, inside of which are a number of partitions or blades. The barrel or the blades are rotated by motor power and the resultant beating action hardens the cream to foam and gradually converts it into butter.
(2) Combined churns and workers. These machines, which are used for continuous production of butter, consist essentially of electric motors that drive cylinders with fast rotating elements which transform the cream into butter. The butter is pressed through the working elements of the machine as a continuous length.
(3) Machines for moulding butter into the required commercial shapes, but not including machines which also wrap or weigh the product (headings 84.22 and 84.23).
(B) Cheese-making machines.
(1) Machines for breaking up and homogenising the mixtures of curd and cream in the manufacture of soft or cream cheeses.
(2) Machines for moulding hard, semi-hard and soft or cream cheeses, but not including machines which also wrap or weigh the product (headings 84.22 and 84.23).
(3) Cheese presses (e.g., of the mechanical, pneumatic, etc., types) are used, especially in the manufacture of harder cheeses, both to shape the product and to eliminate the superfluous moisture.
It should be noted that the heading excludes many machines and apparatus used in the dairy industry. For example, storage, maturing, processing, etc., vats and tanks whose operation depends primarily on fitted heating or cooling equipment fall in heading 84.18 or 84.19, whether or not they also incorporate mechanical equipment such as agitators. Vats, etc., not fitted with heating or cooling equipment, but incorporating mechanical features such as stirrers, agitators, tipping mechanisms, etc., are classified in this heading provided they are identifiable as specialized for dairy use. If they are not identifiable as for any one particular use, they are classified in heading 84.79. Vats, etc., not fitted with either thermal or mechanical equipment are classified as articles of the constituent material (e.g., heading 73.09, 73.10, 74.19, 76.11, or 76.12).
PARTS
Subject to the general provisions regarding the classification of parts (see the General Explanatory Note to Section XVI), parts of the machines of this heading are also classified here, e.g. :
Pails, lids, pulsators, teat-cups and fittings (other than rubber liners, etc. - heading 40.16) for milking machines; butter churn barrels; rollers and tables for butter workers; moulds for butter and cheese moulding machines.
The heading excludes domestic appliances falling in heading 82.10 or 85.09."
34,8435,"84.35 Presses, crushers and similar machinery used in the manufacture of wine, cider, fruit juices or similar beverages.
8435.10 Machinery
8435.90 Parts
The heading covers both agricultural and industrial type machines used for making wine, cider, perry, fruit juices or similar beverages whether or not fermented. This heading also includes machines for commercial use, of a type used in restaurants or similar establishments.
The heading includes, inter alia :
(A) Juice extracting machines, hand or power operated, for juices not intended for fermentation (e.g., juices of citrus fruit, peaches, apricots, pineapples, berries or tomatoes).
(B) Apple or pear crushers, hand or power operated. They consist of a hopper which feeds fruit to the grating mechanism or crushing cylinders.
(C) Mechanical or hydraulic cider presses, including “mobile” presses mounted on wheeled trolleys.
(D) Grape pressing or crushing machines, e.g. :
(1) Grape crushing machines. These usually consist of two grooved cylinders, or of a single cylinder fitted with beaters, which extract the juice from the grapes without crushing the seeds or stems.

(B) Strainers. In these the dilute pulp passes through screens leaving behind any fibres insufficiently ground and any knots, lumps, dirt, etc. Those operated by centrifugal action, however, are excluded (heading 84.21).
(C) Wet lappers (presse pâte machines). In these the pulpy mass of wood fibres, whether from the mechanical grinders or from the chemical digesters, is concentrated and formed into sheets.
(D) Refiners. These usually comprise a cone shaped case with internal revolving bars which break up any large fibres or lumps and allow the stock that is already sufficiently beaten to pass straight through.
(E) Crushers and grinders which treat previously prepared paper pulp with a view to producing a cellulosic pulp specially constituted for a particular application (for example, preparation of nitrocellulose).
(II) MACHINERY FOR MAKING PAPER OR PAPERBOARD
This group includes :
(A) Machines for forming the stock into continuous sheets of paper or paperboard (e.g., Fourdrinier machines or twin wire machines). These are very complex machines. They consist of regulators for feeding the stock to the head box, a slice at the output end of the head box for distributing the stock onto an endless band, usually a woven fabric of synthetic monofilaments, supported on a breast roll or a forming roll, foils, table rolls, shake mechanism, suction boxes, dandy rolls for watermarking, couch rolls for increasing the dry solids content and consolidating the paper, press rolls forming at least one press nip, one press roll may include a press shoe and a surrounding, rotable belt loop, in which the paper is pressed against one or between two endless felt belts or other process belts, drying rolls, steam boxes, etc., and usually also calender rolls and reeling devices, etc.
(B) Vat machines. These are similar in principle to those at (A) but, instead of the pulp flowing out on to an endless band of wire cloth, it is picked up from a vat on a revolving cylinder of wire cloth from which it is transferred to a felt band and then on to press rolls (sometimes of the suction type) and finally to a series of drying cylinders. The paper or paperboard is produced either in the form of continuous web or in sheets. In certain of these machines, sheets of paperboard are formed by the layer of pulp winding round and round a cylinder. When a sufficient thickness is built up, it is cut off in the form of sheets, either by hand or mechanically along the length of the cylinder.
(C) Machines for the manufacture of multi-layered paper, board or paperboard. These machines consist of different combinations of Fourdrinier formers or twin wire formers. The different web layers are produced simultaneously and are joined in a humid state in the machine, as a rule without a binder.
(D) Sample drawing apparatus for making paper samples intended for testing. These machines are sometimes called “sample drawing machines” for controlling manufacture.
(III) MACHINERY FOR FINISHING PAPER OR PAPERBOARD
This group includes :
(A) Reeling machines. Some of these at the same time stretch and smooth the paper and discharge any static electricity.
(B) Machines (other than calenders) for applying various kinds of surface coatings, inorganic or organic pigment layers, size, gum, silicon, wax, etc.; for coating carbon papers or photographic papers; for coating paper with textile dust, cork or mica powder, etc., for wallpapers.
(C) Machines for impregnating paper or paperboard with oil, plastics, etc., and machines for making bituminised or tarred roofing papers.
(D) Ruling machines working by means of small discs or steel pens fed from an ink bath, but not printing machines of heading 84.43.
(E) Crêping machines. These normally consist of a metal scraper or doctor which scrapes the paper from a heated cylinder, so that crinkling of the paper occurs. However, crêping is usually carried out in the papermaking machine.
(F) Machines for humidifying paper (also called “paper conditioners”) in which the entire surface of the paper or paperboard is exposed to humid air.
(G) Machines for graining and embossing (however, calenders used for the same purpose fall in heading 84.20).
(H) Corrugating machines, may be combined with a laminating device.
Certain paper finishing machines (e.g., for coating, laminating or reeling), may also be suitable for use in the working of metal foil, plastic sheets, woven fabric, etc., but they remain in this heading provided they are of a type mainly used for paper or paperboard.
Composite machines of this heading sometimes incorporate certain machines falling in other headings of the Chapter (e.g., filters for recovery of fibres and loading material from waste waters (heading 84.21), calenders of all kinds (for smoothing, glazing, embossing, etc.) (heading 84.20), paper cutting machines (heading 84.41)). Provided they are presented together, such component machines are classified with the composite machines in this heading, but if presented separately they are classified in their respective headings.

(I) PRINTING MACHINERY USED FOR PRINTING BY MEANS OF PLATES, CYLINDERS AND OTHER PRINTING COMPONENTS
OF HEADING 84.42
The most common of these machines are rotary presses. In their simplest form, these presses usually consist of a cylinder with two semi-cylindrical plates (letter press), or of cylinders which may be either engraved (gravure printing) or impressed (offset printing); rotary presses for colour-printing are equipped with several printing cylinders, their inking rollers being placed side by side. Since all the printing, pressing and inking mechanisms are rotary, these presses can be used for both continuous printing and sheet by sheet printing, in black or in colour, on single sides or on both sides of the paper. Rotary presses can be divided into two sub-categories :
(1) Reel-fed presses, in which some large rotary presses combine several printing units on a single frame, and which enable all the pages of a newspaper or periodical to be printed in one sequence of operations, so that, in the final result, all the pages are delivered, cut, folded, assembled, stapled and stacked by various ancillary machines working in conjunction with the printing machine.
(2) Sheet-fed presses, in which the sheets are transported through the printing units by grippers. Sheet-fed presses have a feeder, one or more printing units, and a delivery mechanism. In the feeder the sheets are taken from a pile, aligned, and forwarded to the printing unit. In the delivery mechanism the printed sheets are collected in a pile.
This group also includes printing presses using a movable plate (or platen), and cylinder printing machines.
The above printing presses (particularly the small or medium-sized rotary presses) can be fitted with a series of making-up units arranged side by side with the printing units, so that, starting from a single reel of paper, complex products (e.g., box shapes, packagings, labels, railway tickets) can be completed in one single and continuous operation.
In addition to the typical types of printing machines, this heading also covers special machines such as :
(i) Machines for printing tin foil boxes or other containers.
(ii) Machines for printing clock or watch dials or other articles of special shapes.
(iii) Machines for printing on corks, tubes, candles, etc.
(iv) Machines for marking clothing.
(v) Machines for printing book page signatures.
(vi) Numbering, dating, etc., machines (other than hand-operated date and similar stamps of heading 96.11) operating with irons, bands of letters or figures, etc., whether or not inked.
(vii) Certain small office printing machines which operate by means of printing type or by the offset process, and which are improperly referred to as “duplicating machines” because their operating principles and appearance are similar to those of duplicating machines.
This group also includes colour printing machines, used to colour, after they have been first printed in black and white, special art editions, playing cards, children’s illustrations, etc., by means of stencils or stencil-plates, the colour being applied by brushes, rollers or by spraying.
Machines for printing a repetitive design, repetitive words or overall colour on textiles, wallpaper, wrapping paper, linoleum, leather, etc., include :
(1) Block printing machines in which blocks engraved with the design, generally in relief, are repeatedly pressed on the cloth, wallpaper, etc., as it passes through the machine, thus producing a continuous design; the same machines are also used for printing separate designs (e.g., on scarves or handkerchiefs).
(2) Roller printing machines, usually consisting of a large central cylinder (pressure bowl) around the periphery of which is placed a series of engraved colour rollers, each with its colour trough, furnisher roller, doctor blades, etc.
(3) Screen printing machines. The material to be printed passes through the machine together with a stencil screen band, the colour being applied through the stencil.
(4) Warp printing machines which, before weaving, print a design on the sheet of parallel warp yarns unrolled from the warp beam.
(5) Yarn printing machines. These produce colour effects on the yarn (or sometimes on the roving before it is spun into yarn).
(II) OTHER PRINTERS, COPYING MACHINES
AND FACSIMILE MACHINES,
WHETHER OR NOT COMBINED
This group covers :
(A) Printers.
This group includes apparatus for the printing of text, characters or images on print media, other than those that are described in Part (I) above.
These apparatus accept data from various sources (e.g., automatic data processing machines, flatbed desktop scanners, networks). Most incorporate memory to store that data.
The products of this heading may create the characters or images by means such as laser, ink-jet, dot matrix or thermal print processes. The two most common types of printers are :
(1) Electrostatic printers, which employ a process that involves electrostatic charges, toner and light. A light source (e.g., a laser, a light-emitting diode(LED)) is used to cancel the charge at specific points on a positively charged photoconductive surface (usually a drum) leaving a positively charged replica of the image. The negatively charged toner is electrostatically attracted to the photoconductive surface, reproducing the original image. The toner is electrostatically transferred to the print medium, which has a stronger positive charge than the photoconductive surface, and the image is then fused to the print medium by applying pressure and heat.
(2) Inkjet printers. These machines place drops of ink onto a print medium to create an image.
This heading includes printers presented separately for incorporation in or connection to other products of the nomenclature (e.g., receipt printers of cash registers of heading 84.70).
(B) Copying machines.
This group includes apparatus for the production of copies from original documents, such as :
(1) Digital copiers in which the original document is scanned and a photosensitive surface (e.g., a charge-coupled device (CCD) or photo-diode sensing array) converts the optical image into digitally coded electrical signals that are stored in memory. The print engine, which operates in the same manner as the printers described in Part (II) (A) of this Explanatory Note, then uses that data to produce the required number of copies. Original documents need only be scanned once to produce multiple copies, as the digital representation of the image is stored in memory. Part (D) below describes such apparatus when capable of connecting to an automatic data processing machine or to a network.
(2) Photocopiers in which the optical image of the original document must be projected onto the photosensitive surface for each copy. The most common types are :
(a) Electrostatic photocopying apparatus which operates either by reproducing the original image directly onto the copy (direct process) or by reproducing the original image via an intermediate onto the copy (indirect process).
In the direct process the optical image is projected onto a substrate (usually of paper) coated with, for example, zinc oxide or anthracene, charged with static electricity. After the latent image has been developed by means of a powdered dye, it is fixed to the substrate by heat treatment.
In the indirect process, the optical image is projected onto a drum (or plate) coated with selenium or other semiconducting substance charged with static electricity. After the latent image has been developed by means of a powdered dye, it is transferred onto ordinary paper by applying an electrostatic field and fixed to the paper by heat treatment.
(b) Apparatus using chemical emulsion coatings in which the photosensitive surface consists of an emulsion usually containing silver salts or diazo compounds (the latter being designed for exposure to light with a high ultraviolet content). The developing and printing processes vary according to the nature of the emulsion and the type of apparatus (wet or dry developers, heat treatment, ammonia vapour, transfer techniques, etc.).
This group also includes contact type photocopying apparatus and thermo-copying apparatus.
(C) Facsimile machines.
Facsimile (or fax) machines are for the transmission and reception of text or graphics over a network and for the printing of a reproduction of the original text or graphics. Part (D) below describes such apparatus when capable of performing a copying function.
(D) Combinations of printers, copying machines or facsimile machines.
Machines which perform two or more of the functions of printing, copying or facsimile transmission are generally referred to as multi-functional machines. These machines are capable of connecting to an automatic data processing machine or to a network.
The criterion “capable of connecting to an automatic data processing machine or to a network” is described in the Subheading Explanatory Note below.
PARTS AND ACCESSORIES
Subject to the general provisions regarding the classification of parts (see the General Explanatory Note to Section XVI), the heading also covers parts and accessories of the machines of this heading.
This would include, for example, machines (whether or not presented separately) for uses ancillary to printing exclusively designed to operate with printing machines and used during or after the printing operation for feeding, handling or further working the sheets or rolls of paper. Such machines, which are usually separate from the printing machine itself, include :
(1) Stock or pile elevators and paper trays or drawers, which hold the blank sheets ready to be printed.
(2) Automatic feeders, used for sheet by sheet printing. Their function is to feed sheets one by one, perfectly centred, into the machine.
(3) Sheet delivery mechanisms, similar in design to feeders, but carrying out the reverse process (i.e., they deliver and pile the printed sheets).
(4) Sorters, which stack and collate printed sheets of multi-page documents.
(5) Folders, gummers, perforators and staplers. These are often used, at the delivery end of the printing machine, to fold and staple or stitch printed pages (of newspapers, folders, periodicals, etc.).
If, however, they are not designed exclusively for use in conjunction with a printing machine, they are excluded (heading 84.40 or 84.41, as the case may be).
(6) Serial numbering machines, small accessory machines operating with rolls of figures.
(7) Bronzing machines for the printing industry. These deposit metal powder on sheets as they emerge from the printing machine in which they have just been mordant-printed.
This heading also includes drums and plates used in electrostatic photocopying apparatus, guide rollers and mounted oil supply pads.
The heading also excludes :
(a) Cylinder blankets and covers of textile fabric, rubberised textile fabric, felt, rubber, etc. (classified according to the constituent material).
(b) Machinery for labelling bottles, cans, boxes, bags or other containers, and wrapping machinery (heading 84.22).
(c) Machines with an ancillary printing device, e.g., certain bag filling or packing machines (heading 84.22); certain machines for making up paper or paperboard (heading 84.41). If presented separately, the printing device remains classified in this heading provided it prints by one of the processes of the machines of this heading.

Subheading Explanatory Notes.
Subheadings 8443.11, 8443.12 and 8443.13
These subheadings cover printing machinery in which the impression is obtained by means of a printing plate on which the design is reproduced in the flat, i.e., in neither intaglio nor relief (offset printing process). The formation of the image to be printed is based on the principle of the mutual repulsion of water and fatty substances. The printing, always performed on a rotary machine, is not obtained by direct contact of the printing medium on the material to be printed, but by intermediate transfer onto a rubber cylinder called a blanket which, in turn, transfers the image onto the matter to be printed. The machinery of these subheadings is characterised by the presence of the blanket and of a device used to continuously dampen the non printing parts of the printing plate which is fixed to a metal cylinder. Offset printing machines can be fed by rolls or sheets.
Subheadings 8443.14 and 8443.15
Letterpress printing is a process whereby the ink is transferred under pressure to the printing surface from the raised parts of the type. The type consists of individual characters, lines or image-bearing plates, all of the same height.
These subheadings do not, however, cover flexographic printing machinery.
Subheading 8443.16
Flexographic printing is a process employing the letterpress principle for simple work (printing of packaging, forms, leaflets, etc.), and in which the printing plate is of rubber or thermoplastic material bonded directly to the impression cylinder. These machines are simpler and lighter than other printing presses; they print continuous webs of paper in one or more colours, using an ink based on alcohol or other volatile solvents.
Subheading 8443.17
In gravure printing, the ink accumulated in different volumes in engraved or etched parts of the printing plate is transferred by pressure onto the surface to be printed. This form of printing has its origins in line engraving and etching, where a graver or an acid is used to incise lines of different depths in a polished copper plate. The surface of the plate remains free of ink, which collects in the lines in sufficient quantity to yield an impression.
The principle of gravure printing is similar to that of line engraving and etching. A rotary cylinder is used instead of the plate. The image or signs are transferred onto a cylindrical plate electroplated with copper by mechanical or photochemical means.
Subheadings 8443.31 and 8443.32
The criterion “capable of connecting to an automatic data processing machine or to a network” denotes that the apparatus comprises all the components necessary for its connection to a network or an automatic data processing machine to be effected simply by attaching a cable. The capability to accept the addition of a component (e.g., a “card”) that would then allow the connection of a cable is not sufficient to meet the terms of these subheadings. Conversely, that the component to which a cable would be connected is present but inaccessible or otherwise unable to effect a connection (e.g., switches must first be set) is not sufficient to exclude goods from these subheadings."
43,8444,"84.44 Machines for extruding, drawing, texturing or cutting man-made textile materials.
This heading covers machines for the manufacture of man-made textile fibres, including machines for cutting the fibres.
These include :
(1) Machines for extruding man-made textiles in the form of monofilaments or of several filaments. These machines are, in practice, made up of a long series of separate identical spinning units placed side by side. Each unit consists essentially of a metering pump and a filter which feed the spinnerets or spinning nozzles. Depending on the process employed, the one or more filaments leaving the nozzles pass either through a bath containing a chemical coagulating agent (e.g., viscose process), or through an airtight chamber fitted with a water spray (e.g., cuprammonium process) or a hot air current (e.g., cellulose acetate process), or through a cooling chamber. The nozzles may be single or contain a great number of holes (sometimes many thousands) according to whether it is desired to obtain a monofil, or a multi filament yarn, or tow for cutting into staple fibre. In some machines the fibres emerging from the nozzle are brought together and assembled by a slight twist given by a special device, thus forming a yarn. In others, the fibres leaving the various spinning units are combined in a thick rope (tow), sometimes of many hundreds of thousands of fibres, for subsequent cutting into staple fibre.
(2) Drawing machines which stretch the filaments to three or four times their original length, a process which orientates the molecules in the direction of the filaments thus considerably increasing its strength.
(3) Machines for texturing synthetic textile yarn. Most texturing processes (traditional discontinuous method, false-twisting, edge crimping, gear-crimping, hot air or steam jets, knit-deknit) modify the physical properties of the yarn to produce crimped yarn, elastic “foam” yarn, etc.
(4) Staple fibre cutters for cutting tow into short lengths.
(5) “Tow to top” machines. These also cut the tow into staple fibre lengths, but they do not disturb the parallel arrangements of the fibres in the tow. These machines therefore produce tops which are ready for spinning (requiring neither carding nor combing), and not a loose mass of staple fibres like the cutters of paragraph (4). They sometimes incorporate a spinning machine and are then called “tow to yarn” machines (see Explanatory Note to heading 84.45).
(6) Rupturing machines for producing ruptured filament tow. The greater part (but not all) of the filaments are broken at intervals so that, although some filaments remain continuous, the yarn obtained from the tow has the characteristics of a staple fibre yarn.

(A) MACHINERY FOR PREPARING NATURAL TEXTILE FIBRES
OR SHORT MAN MADE FIBRES UP TO THE SPINNING STAGE,
AND SIMILAR MACHINES WHICH PREPARE THE FIBRES FOR USE
AS STUFFING OR FOR THE MANUFACTURE OF FELT OR WADDING
This group includes :
(1) Blower-grader machines for sorting animal hair according to length. These consist of a long box divided across its width into compartments into which the hairs are blown by a current of air. The hairs are distributed into the various compartments according to their size.
(2) Machines for separating cotton fibres from the seeds, hulls and other impurities (e.g., cotton gins), and similar machines for separating linters from the seed.
(3) Scutching or similar machines for separating the fibres from vegetable stalks (flax, hemp, etc.) after retting.
(4) Machines for tearing rags, old cordage or similar scrap textiles to reduce them to a fibrous condition suitable for carding (e.g., garnetting machines and rag pickers), but excluding rag cutters used in paper making (heading 84.39).
(5) Bale breakers, used for opening out into lumps the cotton from compressed bales.
(6) Automatic feeders, fitted with a spreading device to secure an even flow to the openers.
(7) Beaters and spreaders for further cleaning and opening out the web of cotton fibres; preparing machines for opening wool.
(8) Wool scouring machines with mechanical arrangements for feeding in the wool and pumping in hot water; and raw wool washing machines (e.g., Leviathans) equipped with stirring mechanism and sometimes means for drying.
(9) Raw stock dyeing machines for dyeing unspun wool fibres in the mass.
(10) Machines for impregnating wool, ramie, etc., with oil or chemical products to facilitate carding and combing.
(11) Wool carbonising machines, equipped with a vat for acid, arrangements for removing excess liquor, for drying and for dusting out the charred impurities.
(12) Carding machines of various types for cotton, wool, short man-made fibres, bast fibres (flax, hemp, etc.), etc. These continue the cleaning begun by the openers and beaters, and separate and straighten the fibres. In principle they consist of large rollers covered with saw-toothed steel wire or with fabric fitted with wire teeth (card clothing); these work against fixed plates or other rollers which are also covered with card clothing. A cleaning device keeps the teeth free from clogging with fibres, and in wool carding machines there is a device for eliminating burrs. Different carding machines are used at different stages for different materials (e.g., breaker cards, intermediate cards, finisher cards, condenser cards). The fibres leave the carding machines in the form of a wide web or lap, or may be condensed into a sliver, and are then wound on spools or bobbins or coiled into rotating bins.
This group also covers carding machines for preparing fibres for felting or for use as wadding or stuffing; these are usually a simpler type consisting of a cylindrical segment covered with card clothing, which oscillates over a flat table also covered with card clothing.
(13) Draw boxes, gill boxes, etc. These draw out the slivers to a smaller cross section, combine them and re draw them to produce an even product; these machines are used after carding and, in the case of wool, sometimes also after combing.
(14) Combing machines. The principal function of these machines is to comb out short fibres; the sliver is held between nippers while being acted on by an arrangement of combs or pins. They are used at various stages of manufacture : to treat the material in the raw state (e.g., hackling flax), or after carding or drawing out. The most common types are combing machines for flax, hemp or similar fibres, intermittent (French or rectilinear) combs for cotton, and circular combs for wool.
(15) Flax, jute, etc., spreaders. These combine the bundles of flax or other fibres, and draw them out into a continuous sliver.
(16) Backwashing machines for removing the oil and other impurities from wool after carding or combing. They consist of a number of vats for warm soapy water, equipped with guide and squeeze rollers, drying cylinders and a gill box to open out the wool again.
(17) Drawing or roving machines for finally drawing and slightly twisting the slivers or rovings to make them ready for spinning.
(18) Coilers. These consist of a turntable designed to rotate a can in which the slivers or rovings are collected as they leave the various machines; they usually have a coiling device at the top.
(B) MACHINES FOR PREPARING SILK
PRIOR TO THROWING
This group includes :
(1) Machines for removing the outer parts of cocoons, and machines for removing, by beating the cocoons, the outer filaments which cannot be reeled.
(2) Vessels for unreeling by hand the silk threads from cocoons, equipped with a device for assembling and slightly twisting together several filaments and sometimes with the reel on which the raw silk obtained is wound; the reel is sometimes separate from the vessel but provided the reel and vessel are presented together the whole unit remains classified here.
(3) Machines for removing lumps, thicker parts, etc., from the raw silk yarn.
(C) SPINNING MACHINES FOR CONVERTING ROVINGS INTO YARN;
TWISTING MACHINES AND MACHINES FOR DOUBLING YARNS
TO FORM MULTIPLE OR CABLED YARNS
This group includes :
(1) Spinning frames which by a further drawing out and twisting convert the roving into a yarn. The essential feature of a spinning frame is the spinning mechanism (flyer ring and traveller, etc.) associated with a revolving vertical or oblique spindle; a complete spinning frame consists of a number of these elements mounted side by side. The heading includes flax, hemp, jute, etc., spinning machines, intermittent spinning frames (mules, etc.) and continuous spinning frames (flyer spinning, ring spinning, cap spinning, etc.). It also covers hand spinning wheels.
(2) “Tow to yarn” machines. These complete the whole process of breaking the filaments of the tow, drawing out into a roving and spinning into yarn.
(3) Twisting or doubling machines for giving a supplementary torsion to yarns, or for twisting together two or more yarns to form a multiple or cabled yarn or to form twine; special machines for rope making are, however, excluded (heading 84.79). Certain machines of this group may include devices for producing fancy yarns (e.g., looped yarns).
This group also includes throwing machines for twisting together continuous filaments of silk or of man-made textiles.
(4) Machines for knotting together, end to end, lengths of horsehair.
(D) WINDING OR REELING MACHINES
These are used for putting up yarns (or rovings), twine or string, on bobbins, spools, cops, cones, cheeses, cards, etc., or in balls, hanks or skeins, etc., whether for manufacturing or trade purposes, or for retail sale. For the classification of warping machines, see Part (E) below. Machines for coiling ropes or cables are classified in heading 84.79.
The heading also includes machines for recovering and re reeling yarn from faulty knitted or crocheted goods. It also covers weft winders specially designed to wind the weft yarns on to bobbins ready for use in weaving.
(E) MACHINES FOR PREPARING TEXTILE YARNS FOR USE
ON THE MACHINES OF HEADING 84.46 OR 84.47
This group includes :
(1) Warpers for preparing a series of yarns parallel, under the same tension, and in the right order (as regards colour and type of yarn) for weaving. The complete number of yarns required for the warp may be prepared as a whole, or they may be prepared in sections (sectional warping); they may be wound directly on the warp beam ready for use on the loom, or provisionally on the roller of the warping machine or on other supports (e.g., bobbins).
The machine consists of a creel for holding a large number of bobbins of yarn, a series of combs and thread guides and a powerful drum winding mechanism; the various parts of this machine are usually quite separate, but when presented together they remain classified here.
(2) Warp sizing machines (e.g., slashing machines). In these the warp yarns, either in sections or as a sheet of parallel yarns, are given a temporary dressing to protect them from fraying on the loom and to make them smooth, thus facilitating weaving. These machines consist generally of a size bath, a system of roller guides, a heated cylinder or hot air dryer and a reeling device, and sometimes also a device for cut marking (i.e., the application of dye marks at regular intervals on the selvedge yarns).
The heading does not cover other sizing machines, e.g., for sizing other yarns (including weft yarns) in hanks or as separate yarns (heading 84.51).
(3) Drawing in and reeding machines for drawing the warp yarns through the respective healds (heddles) of the loom, and through the reed or comb.
(4) Warp tying in or twisting in machines for uniting the threads of a new warp with those remaining from the former warp.
This heading does not cover warp tyers used to join warp threads which have broken during weaving (heading 84.48).
(5) Machines for assembling warp yarn on the beam from warper drums.
(6) Machines for interlacing and supplying the thread during weaving.
(7) Threading machines for embroidery.

45,8446,"84.46 Weaving machines (looms).
8446.10 - For weaving fabrics of a width not exceeding 30 cm
- For weaving fabrics of a width exceeding 30 cm, shuttle type :
8446.21 - Power looms
8446.29 - Other
8446.30 - For weaving fabrics of a width exceeding 30 cm, shuttleless type
This heading covers weaving machines for the production of fabrics by weaving, using textile (including peat fibre) yarns or other yarns (e.g., of metal, glass or asbestos).
In these machines the warp and weft yarns are interlaced at right angles to form a fabric.
In the simplest weave, the sheet of warp yarns from the warp beam divides into two groups of alternate yarns, each group being controlled by a harness; these harnesses alternately raise and lower their warp yarns to form an angle (known as the shed) between the two groups of yarns through which passes the weft yarn (in conventional looms carried by a shuttle) which is immediately beaten up against the preceding weft by the reed; the raising or lowering of the groups of warp yarn is then reversed by the harnesses, entrapping the weft and forming a new shed for the next line of weft. On ordinary looms up to eight harnesses can be used to vary the order in which the warp yarns are raised and so produce a certain variation in the weave.
More complex looms can execute more complicated weaves. For example, some looms have a special system for controlling the raising of the warp (dobbies, Jacquards, etc.) so as to control a greater number of groups of warp threads or even single warp threads; or special devices can be used to produce certain special fabrics (leno mechanisms, warp pile (or Terry) attachments, swivel shuttle attachments for broché work). Other looms have devices for changing the shuttles (or the bobbins in the shuttles), thus introducing wefts of different colours or different yarns; Looms often include certain other mechanical or electrical devices (e.g., for replenishing the bobbins in the shuttles when necessary, or for stopping the loom if a warp or weft thread breaks).
Most of these special devices may either form an integral part of the loom, or be mounted on an ordinary loom as auxiliary removable attachments; the latter type of attachment is classified here provided it is presented with the loom for which it is intended, but if presented separately it is excluded (generally heading 84.48).
Looms usually produce a flat fabric but there are circular looms which produce a tubular fabric; in these one or more shuttles, moved either mechanically or by electro-magnets, interlace a weft with a vertical series of warp threads arranged in a circle.
Different types of looms may be named according to their type of mechanism or according to the type of fabric they produce, for example, dobby looms, Jacquard looms, automatic box motion looms, shuttleless looms in which the weft is inserted either by compressed air or a water jet or by a long needle, or drawn across from a fixed bobbin by a series of projectiles, ribbon looms (e.g., bar looms, Zurich looms and drum looms), pile fabric looms, carpet looms including knotted pile carpet looms.
The heading also includes :
(1) Hand looms.
(2) Looms for weaving cloth of wire or metallised yarn provided they are of the same type as textile weaving looms. Such looms must have all the essential mechanical parts characteristic of textile weaving looms, i.e., a warp beam, frame harnesses for forming the shed, the mechanism which passes the weft wire or yarn through the shed at right angles and entraps it in the warp yarns and a cloth beam for winding the cloth as it is produced.
However, the heading excludes machines designed for interlacing wire, by various processes, to form heavy wire grill or netting (see Explanatory Note to heading 84.63).
PARTS AND ACCESSORIES
Subject to the general provisions regarding the classification of parts (see the General Explanatory Note to Section XVI), parts and accessories of weaving machines of this heading are classified in heading 84.48."
46,8447,"84.47 Knitting machines, stitch-bonding machines and machines for making gimped yarn, tulle, lace, embroidery, trimmings, braid or net and machines for tufting.
- Circular knitting machines :
8447.11 - With cylinder diameter not exceeding 165 mm
8447.12 - With cylinder diameter exceeding 165 mm
8447.20 - Flat knitting machines; stitch-bonding machines
8447.90 - Other
This heading covers all machinery for the production of fabrics or trimmings by knitting, stitch-bonding, gimping, braiding, netting, tufting, etc., or for embroidery work on any ground, whether using unspun rovings, textile (including peat fibre) yarns, other yarns (e.g., of metal, glass or asbestos) or wire.
(A) KNITTING MACHINES
These consist of two main groups :
(1) Circular machines which produce either a straight tubular fabric or, by varying the size of the stitches in the rows, a shaped tubular piece (for stockings, socks, sleeves of garments, berets, fezes or similar knitted headgear, etc.).
(2) Flat machines for producing flat fabric of even width or, by increasing or decreasing the number of stitches in the rows, flat but shaped pieces of fabric to be subsequently made up by sewing (e.g., into stockings or socks). Flat machines include machines for ordinary knitting (e.g., Cotton’s frames) and warp knitting (Raschel, milanese, locknit, etc., looms). These machines range from the very simple type to large machines with many rows of needles, in some cases equipped with Jacquard or similar mechanisms to produce various designs.
This heading also covers small domestic knitting machines, and machines designed to knit just the few stitches necessary for repairing stockings. Machines for joining two pieces of knitted fabric by simply sewing together the loops forming the knitted edges are classified in heading 84.52.
(B) STITCH-BONDING MACHINES
This group includes all kinds of stitch-bonding machines which produce fabrics by a chain-stitching process. The following are included :
(1) Machines incorporating a needle mechanism for attaching the “warp” yarns and the “weft” yarns by chain stitching.
(2) Machines for inserting loops of yarn in a fabric backing previously produced on a conventional weaving loom, and attaching them to the backing with knitting stitches.
(3) Knitting-sewing machines operate by stitching seams in loose-fibre fabric already made by other machines (for example, cards and garnetting machines) and so produce a consolidated sheet of textile material used as filtering material, carpet underlay, insulating material, etc.
(C) MACHINES FOR MAKING KNOTTED NET,
TULLE, LACE, BRAID, OR TRIMMINGS,
FOR GIMPING YARNS, FOR EMBROIDERY, FOR TUFTING, ETC.
These include :
(1) Machines for making nets or netting for any purpose, either in the piece or to the shape of finished articles (e.g., fishing nets).
(2) Machines for making plain tulle.
(3) Machines for making figured tulle, lace, etc.
(4) Machines for making bobinot tulle, bobinot curtains and bobinot mechanical lace, which manufacture flat netting or flat net curtains, as well as mechanical (woven) lace from warp and weft strands. However, the warp and weft strands are not interlaced at right angles as in weaving, but are surrounded and tied, by the to and fro movement of a shuttle, by a large number of warp strands (bobbin threads) arranged on small bobbins.
(5) Embroidery machines, including hand embroidery machines (embroidery machines with pantograph shuttles), which, by means of needles, embroider various designs with one or more threads on an existing ground of woven fabric or other material. Embroidery machines, other than manually operated, may be equipped with Jacquard or similar mechanisms. The heading also covers thread drawing machines which withdraw, and bind the remaining threads into open-work embroidery.
The heading does not cover chain or blanket stitch machines (mainly used to edge certain textile articles, but which can also do simple embroidery), nor sewing machines which can do simple embroidery work in addition to ordinary sewing (heading 84.52).
(6) Gimping machines. These wrap one yarn in close spirals round a generally thicker core (e.g., of metal wire, rubber thread, unspun fibres, or of one or more coarser yarns). These machines can also be used to gimp fine electrical wiring.
(7) Machines for making various trimmings by interlacing, in various complex ways, yarns or unspun rovings (sometimes gimped) of various textiles (braiding looms, hook looms, etc.).
The heading also covers machines for braiding a wire sheath on hose of rubber, plastics, etc., or for braiding tubular plaits from wire, provided they have the essential mechanical parts characteristic of the textile machines referred to in the preceding paragraph.
(8) Machines for covering buttons, tassel cores, etc., with textile threads.
(9) Tufting machines, for inserting loops or tufts of textile yarn in a fabric backing in order to produce carpets, mats or lightweight articles (bedspreads, bath robes, etc.).

This heading covers :
(I) All auxiliary machines and apparatus which exercise, either separately or concurrently, a function complementary to those of the machines of heading 84.44, 84.45, 84.46 or 84.47 (in particular spinning, weaving, knitting or embroidery machines). These auxiliary machines may either extend the possibilities of the main machines (as in the case of dobbies and Jacquards), or may perform mechanically a particular job necessary for the proper working of the main machine (as is the case with warp stop motions, weft stop motions, warp knotting machines).
(II) Parts of the machines of this heading and also parts of the machines of heading 84.44, 84.45, 84.46 or 84.47 (see the General Explanatory Note to Section XVI).
(III) Various accessories used with the machines of heading 84.44, 84.45, 84.46 or 84.47 or of this heading; in general, the term “accessories” refers to articles of equipment, not forming an integral part of the machines, which are interchangeable and must be frequently replaced (for example, because they are rapidly worn out, or because different types are necessary for different types of work).
(A) AUXILIARY MACHINERY
This group includes :
(1) Auxiliary machines for use with textile spinning machines, for example, automatic devices which remove fully wound reels and replace them with empty ones, and mobile appliances for setting up rows of empty reels.
(2) Warp beam stands or creels. These hold the warp beams during the sizing process, or during the winding of the warp beam; in certain cases, they hold the warp beam, in the course of weaving.
(3) Dobbies and Jacquards, used to adapt a loom for producing weaves more complicated than it could otherwise execute. Dobbies control the separate lifting of a large number of harnesses, and Jacquards the lifting of individual warp threads. They operate by a number of lags with projecting pegs which form a chain, or in many cases (particularly Jacquards) by a series of suitably perforated cards loosely laced together edge to edge to form a continuous chain. These pegs or a number of needles, certain of which come into play according to the different perforations of the cards, actuate the mechanisms for lifting the warp threads. Similar mechanisms (Verdol machines) are operated with continuous strips of perforated paper.
(4) Machines for mounting on Jacquards to enable certain of the cards to remain in position while more than one weft is inserted. This reduces the number of cards required and increases the speed of weaving.
(5) Card lacing machines for assembling the cards in a loose chain ready for use on the Jacquard machines.
(6) Warp stop motions and weft stop motions. These cause the immediate stopping of the loom in the event of a warp or weft thread breaking; also bobbin control mechanisms for ensuring a continuous supply of weft yarn by replenishing the bobbin when necessary. The heading includes apparatus of this kind whether or not operated electrically.
(7) Warp tyers; small machines placed on a loom above the sheet of warp yarns, and used to join them if they break during weaving.
This heading does not cover warp tying in or twisting in machines of heading 84.45.
(8) Leno attachments which, during weaving, cross over certain of the warp threads to form loops through which weft threads pass. They are used in the manufacture of gauze and other leno fabrics.
(9) Swivel shuttle attachments; these enable a swivel shuttle to be passed between certain warps to produce broché designs.
(10) Warp pile motions which, by a variable motion of the comb, form loops on one or both surfaces of the fabric (Terry fabrics, etc.).
(11) Split selvedge machines. When a wide loom is used to produce simultaneously a number of narrow fabrics, these machines produce a leno weave or insert a form of oversewing where the weft threads are to be cut to separate the narrow fabrics.
(12) Apparatus incorporating photoelectric cells, which detect faults in fabrics being knitted, yarns being wound on a warping frame, etc., and stop the motion of the machine with which they are used as soon as they detect a fault.
(13) Automatic spool changers for weaving machines.
(14) Machines for placing thin plates in automatic stop motions.
(15) Warp-protectors for warpers, warp sizing machines and knitting machines.
(16) Bobbin holders.
(17) Screens and beaters (beating wings) for openers and beaters for mechanical stitchers.
(18) Cylinders and drums for mechanical stitchers, cards or combing machines.
(19) Agitators, drums and cylinders for wool degreasing machines or for greasing machines.

48,8449,"84.49 Machinery for the manufacture or finishing of felt or nonwovens in the piece or in shapes, including machinery for making felt hats; blocks for making hats.
The heading covers machinery for the manufacture or finishing of all kinds of felt or nonwovens or of articles of felt or nonwovens, but excluding those for the manufacture of felted woven fabrics. The heading also covers blocks for making hats.
Machines used in the preliminary operations before felting (e.g., blower grading machines for sorting hair, textile openers, beaters and cards) are the same as those used in the preliminary operations for preparing fibres for spinning, and remain classified in heading 84.45.
(A) MACHINES FOR THE MANUFACTURE OR FINISHING
OF FELT OR NONWOVENS IN GENERAL
This group includes :
(1) Felters, generally composed of two heavy grooved plates, one fixed and the other capable of reciprocating movement, between which the web of carded fibres is submitted to friction and high pressure and becomes felted. These machines also include devices for moistening the web and heating the plates.
In certain types of these machines the plates are replaced by fluted rollers.
(2) Soaping machines to soap the partially formed felt.
(3) Fulling mills. In these the felt pieces, previously soaped, are pounded with hammers to complete the felting. Such mills remain here even though, exceptionally, they can be used for fulling small woven or knitted textile articles; on the other hand, rotary milling machines which are mainly used for fulling or felting woven fabrics are excluded (heading 84.51).
(4) Machines for the manufacture of reinforced felts. The felt and a support of woollen fabric may be felted together by the action of a heated roller; or a series of barbed needles may be used to punch some of the fibres into a non woollen base fabric prior to felting.
(5) Finishing machines for felts, such as smoothing and polishing, shaving, etc.
(6) Machines for the manufacture of nonwovens (such as those employing the dry process, wet process or direct spinning).
(B) MACHINERY FOR MAKING FELT HATS
This group includes :
(1) Machines for felting animal hair into hat shapes. They consist of a roller system feeding the hair to rotating brushes or revolving belts of card clothing, and these throw the hair on to revolving perforated metal cones (or gauze cones). A strong current of air sucks the hair to the surface of the cone forming a layer on its surface.
(2) Felting presses, with grooved faces usually of wood, one or both of which are capable of reciprocating motion, between which the pre formed hat shape is felted.
(3) Roller presses to complete the felting of the hat shapes.
(4) Stretching machines on which the conical hat shape is further formed and the conical end rounded.
(5) Machines in which the brim is formed by passing the edges through conical rollers.
(6) Polishing machines, which remove outstanding hairs from the surface by means of pumice stone or abrasive cloth.
(7) Singeing machines for burning off hairs from the surface of the hat shape.
(8) Proofing machines in which certain hat-shapes are soaked or sprayed with shellac or gelatin, and pressed between rollers.
(9) Blocking machines in which the turning of the brim is completed, and the hat-shape is given its final form.
(10) Sand presses; these press bags of hot sand against the inside of the hat-shape placed on a hollow former, thus restoring the surface of the felt disturbed by previous operations.
(11) Machines with revolving pads to give the felt a smooth shiny surface.
Machines for making woollen felt hats are the same as those described above for making hats from other animal hair felts, except for the first hat shape forming operation. In the case of wool, the layer of fibres from the carding machine is formed into a hat shape by a device consisting of a revolving double conical block.
(C) BLOCKS FOR MAKING HATS
These may be of wood or metal (usually aluminium), and are used with certain of the above machines.
Hat stretching blocks used in hat fitting are also classified here. Machines for tracing head contours used in hat fitting are excluded (heading 90.31).

The fabric, previously impregnated by passing through a bath of bleaching liquor, enters the longer arm where it remains for the time required for the bleaching to take effect, and in due course emerges from the smaller arm.
Other machines of this group are mainly vat-type machines already referred to, adapted for dealing with particular types of textile goods (e.g., yarns in hanks or skeins or in balls, on bobbins, etc., piece goods or made up articles). The group also includes machines for dyeing or dressing textile piece goods in open width; the essential feature of these machines is that they incorporate a set of rollers for squeezing out excess liquid.
(C) DRY CLEANING MACHINERY
These clean with liquids such as petrol, carbon tetrachloride, etc., instead of water. They are usually complex machines incorporating, for example, washers for circulating the liquid through the goods being cleaned, centrifugal extractors, filters, clarifiers and storage tanks. In view of the inflammable nature of many of the liquids used, they usually have an explosion proof motor drive for the washer and circulating pump.
(D) DRYING MACHINES
These machines are classified here only if they are clearly designed and specialised for the drying of textile yarns, fabrics or made up articles. They are of two main types : those consisting essentially of a closed chamber in which the goods to be dried are subjected to the action of hot air, and those in which fabrics are passed over heated rollers.
The heading excludes dryers not specialised for the treatment of textile goods (heading 84.19), and centrifugal dryers (heading 84.21).
(E) DRESSING OR FINISHING MACHINES
This group includes :
(1) Mercerising machines in which yarns or fabric are treated with caustic soda.

(3) Rotary milling machines. These machines close up the warp and weft threads and effect a partial felting on the surface.
Stock or hammer mills, mainly used in the manufacture of felt, are excluded (heading 84.49).
(4) Picking or burling machines, used in the removal of imperfections or pieces of burr still remaining in the fabrics.
(5) Raising machines, used to raise the surface fibres of a cloth. They consist essentially of a large cylinder, mounted either with slats or frames into which teasels can be set, or with smaller cylinders fitted with fine wire points.
(6) Machines for beating the backs of fabrics to make the surface hairs stand up.
(7) Cropping machines to shear the surface of the fabric level after teaseling; similar machines are used in the finishing of velvets. By using indented bed plates or rollers, patterned effects can be obtained.
(8) Ratine or rippling machines used to form wave or bead effects on raised fabrics, by rolling and curling together bunches of fibres. They consist of a plush covered table over which another table (covered with rubber, felt or emery) swings with a short oscillating and circular motion.
(9) Brushing machines; these comprise revolving cylindrical brushes for brushing the fabric after raising or cropping.
(10) Singeing machines for removing the hairiness of yarn or cloth. These work by rapidly passing the cloth over heated cylinders or curved plates, or over gas flames.
(11) Machines for polishing or glazing string, for polishing silk yarn in hanks, or for polishing silk fabrics.
(12) Emery machines for producing a smooth, even surface on fabrics.
(13) Cylindrical presses operating on a flat or semi-circular bed-plate to produce a surface lustre. Calendering machines (heading 84.20) and general purpose hydraulic presses (heading 84.79) are also used for this purpose.
(14) Decatising machines in which the fabric is steam-treated to fix the final finish and set of the cloth; also similar machines for conditioning yarns or fabrics by steam treatment.
(15) Stentering (tentering) machines for restoring the fabric to its proper width.
(16) Shrinking machines, which close up the weft threads to produce a close fabric less likely to shrink subsequently.
(17) Coating or impregnating machines for applying special surface coatings to yarns or fabrics, or for impregnating them with special preparations (e.g., gum, starch, size, wax, plastics, rubber or water proofing compounds). The heading includes machines for coating fabric, paperboard, etc., in the manufacture of floor coverings such as linoleum, and also the dressing machines described in the last sentence of Part (B) above.
(18) Fancy yarn manufacturing machines in which the special effect is produced after the spinning and doubling of the yarn (e.g., machines for ornamenting yarn with small drops of gelatin or wax).
(F) MACHINES FOR REELING, UNREELING, FOLDING,
CUTTING OR PINKING TEXTILE FABRICS
This group includes :
(1) Cloth folding or reeling machines, which fold the cloth lengthwise or across the width, or roll it on to a support; also inspection machines incorporating folding or reeling devices, for inspecting fabrics for defects. Any of these machines may be combined with measuring apparatus.
(2) Cloth cutting or pinking machines, including machines for cutting out patterns or parts of garments, etc.
The following are also classified here :

These are used for converting or refining metals (e.g., for converting iron into steel, or smelting copper or nickel mattes, galena, etc.) by subjecting the materials, previously melted or brought to a high temperature in a furnace, to a strong current of oxygen; by this action most of the carbon and dissolved elements such as manganese, silicon and phosphorus are oxidised and eliminated in the form of gas or molten slag. The oxidation increases the temperature of the metal further.
The most common types of converters are pear shaped or cylindrical vessels consisting of an outer shell of heavy steel plates with an internal lining of refractory material. The oxygen is brought in either by a lance from above (LD-converters (Linz-Donawitz)) or through nozzles in the converter bottom (OBM-converters (Oxygen Bodenblasende Maximilianhütte)). Combinations of the two exist.
Other types include converters with the tuyères incorporated in the sides, rotating cylindrical converters, conical converters (for treating copper matte) with an internal metal grille for supporting the charge.
(B) LADLES
These are used to receive the molten metal from a furnace and pour it into converters or moulds; they are simple open containers generally lined with refractory material, usually fitted with devices to facilitate tipping or pouring and in some cases fitted with wheels. They are usually handled mechanically (e.g., by cranes), but the heading also covers foundry-type casting ladles manipulated by hand. Small hand ladles of the type used by tinsmiths, goldsmiths, etc., are excluded (heading 73.25 or 73.26).
(C) INGOT MOULDS
These may be of various shapes, in one piece or two halves, in which the molten metal is provisionally cast into, e.g., ingots, pigs, slabs.
Other moulds (e.g., for casting articles) are generally classified in heading 84.80.
The moulds of this group are of metal, usually iron or steel. Ingot moulds of graphite or other carbon or of ceramic material are, however, excluded (headings 68.15 and 69.03, respectively).
(D) CASTING MACHINES OF A KIND USED
IN METALLURGY OR IN METAL FOUNDRIES
This group includes :
(1) Machines (generally incorporating a conveyor belt or chain) for the successive filling, cooling and emptying of the moulds. These sometimes incorporate devices for shaking or tapping the moulds to facilitate the even setting of the molten metal.
(2) Machines for casting under pressure. These consist essentially of two adjustable plates to which are fixed the two halves of the mould. The liquid metal from a reservoir is forced into the mould, either by the direct action of compressed air on the free surface of liquid metal in the reservoir, or by the insertion of a piston into a closed reservoir full of the liquid metal. In some cases these machines incorporate cooling devices, to accelerate solidification of the metal, and arrangements for separating the cast article from the mould. They are mainly used for casting small non ferrous metal articles.
However, the heading does not cover machines for moulding metal powders under pressure, by sintering, (heading 84.62).
(3) Centrifugal casting machines in which the molten metal is led into a cylindrical mould rotating at high speed; the metal is thrown on to the sides of the mould and solidifies in the form of a pipe.
(4) Continuous casting machines. In these, steel is conveyed from the ladle in a distributor which feeds the different casting flow lines. These flow lines include :
(a) an ingot mould, without bottom, with its cooling devices;
(b) outside the ingot mould a system for atomising water in order to cool the cast metal;
(c) a group of conveyor rollers allowing the regular extraction of the solidified metal; and
(d) a system of cutting-off machines, followed by an evacuation device.
The moulds to be used with the machines of this group fall usually in heading 68.15, 69.03 or 84.80.

(I) ROLLING MILLS
Rolling mills are metal working machines consisting essentially of a system of rollers between which the metal is passed; the metal is rolled out or shaped by the pressure exerted by the rollers, and at the same time the rolling modifies the structure of the metal and improves its quality. In some cases, in addition to their normal functions, rolling mills may be used to produce a pattern on the metal surface, or to roll together two or more sheets of different metals to produce a laminated product.
Similar machines for rolling materials other than metal, e.g., calenders, are excluded (heading 84.20). Other roller machines (e.g., for gumming metal foil on to a paper support) (heading 84.20), bending, folding, straightening or flattening machines (heading 84.62) are not regarded as rolling mills in the sense described above and are therefore also excluded from this heading.
Rolling mills are of various types according to the particular rolling operations for which they are designed, viz. :
(A) Rolling out to reduce the thickness with a corresponding increase in length (e.g., in the rolling of ingots into blooms, billets or slabs; rolling of slabs into sheet, strip, etc.).
(B) Rolling of blooms, billets, etc., to form a particular cross section (e.g., in the production of bars, rods, angles, shapes, sections, girders, railway rails).
(C) Rolling tubes.
(D) Rolling of wheel blanks or wheel rim blanks (e.g., to shape the flanges of railway wheels).
Most rolling mills are designed for the operations indicated at (A) or (B) above. The essential element of these is known as a “stand”, and consists of two, three or four rolls mounted horizontally one above the other in heavy metal housings, the metal being passed through an adjustable gap between the rollers. In three high and double two high stands, the metal, after being passed between two of the rollers, is then passed through two others; some stands have two or more additional rolls which act as support to give additional power and steadiness to the working rollers.
Most mills consist of a number of such stands arranged either side by side, or slightly staggered, or tandem fashion (for example, continuous rolling mills for sheets); the speeds and gaps of the rollers are adjusted to produce a progressive and gradual rolling down of the metal.
Certain rolling mills may have side rollers for working on the edges of the material, or for producing particular sections (e.g., girders).
For flat products (slabs, sheet, strip, etc.) the rollers are plain (except that certain finishing rollers may produce a simple ridged pattern). In many cases (e.g., for the operations under (B) above) the rolling is not done over the full width of the rolls, but the working rollers have channels cut in their surface so that a gap (or pass) of a particular shape is formed between the two rollers. The metal as it passes through is formed to the shape of the gap, and passing through a succession of such gaps, gradually varying in shape, the metal is thus worked to the desired cross section.
Rolling mills of the kinds referred to above vary considerably in size, from small machines for rolling precious metals up to very heavy rolling mills for steel.
Most of the rolling mills referred to above are for hot rolling, but certain finishing mills (particularly for sheet or strip) roll the metal cold.
Among the rolling mills of the type referred to at (C) and (D) above are :
(1) Mannesmann or similar machines for piercing billets; these have large inclined rollers which rotate the heated billet and force it over a piercing mandrel, thus forming the rough tube.
(2) Mills for rolling out the pierced billets to reduce the thickness of the walls, increase the length and produce a satisfactory surface to the walls. The walls of the tube are worked between a mandrel or plug on the inside, and either rollers with a circular pass or conical rollers on the outside. In certain cases rollers with eccentrically cut channels to give a variable pass are used (step rolling).
(3) Finishing mills for tubes, to finish or reduce the thickness of the walls, or to reduce the diameter, or produce a perfect circular cross section. These may operate with or without an internal mandrel.
(4) Radial mills for rolling the walls of large diameter cast steel tubes. The tube rotates between a number of rollers operating on the outside and corresponding rollers on the inside.
(5) Wheel or disc rolling mills. These usually consist of sets of conical or cylindrical rollers variously arranged, between which the roughly formed wheel revolves; the various parts of the wheel (e.g., flanges of railway wheels) are worked to the required shape by the pressure of the rollers. Similar machines are used for shaping flanged tyres for railway wheels, and for certain railway rails.
In general, the operation of rolling mills requires a large amount of auxiliary equipment such as guides, roller tables, handling equipment, re-heating furnaces, pickling tanks, strip coilers, shears and saws, cooling beds, weighing or marking machines, straightening or flattening machines, control apparatus (mechanical, electric or electronic), etc.
(II) ROLLS AND OTHER PARTS
Subject to the general provisions regarding the classification of parts (see the General Explanatory Note to Section XVI), the heading covers parts of rolling mills. Among the parts covered by this heading are the rolls of rolling mills. These vary considerably in length and diameter, those for steel ranging approximately from 30 to 520 cm in length and from 18 to 137 cm in diameter. They are made of cast iron, or of cast or forged steel, usually specially hardened on the surface and carefully machined to exact dimensions; they may be plain, or with grooves of various shapes to form the necessary passes. Each roll ends in necks, often specially shaped for mounting in the housings of the rolling mill. Outside the roll necks, wobbler-ends are cut to which the driving force is applied."
55,8456,"84.56 Machine-tools for working any material by removal of material, by laser or other light or photon beam, ultra¬sonic, electro-discharge, electro-chemical, electron beam, ionic-beam or plasma arc processes; water-jet cutting machines.

8456.50 - Water-jet cutting machines
8456.90 - Other
The machine-tools of this heading are machines used for the shaping or surface-working of any material. They must meet three essential requirements :
(i) They must work by removing material;
(ii) They must carry out operations of the kind performed by machine-tools equipped with conventional tools;
(iii) They must use one of the following seven processes : laser or other light or photon beam, ultrasonic, electro discharge, electro-chemical, electron beam, ionic-beam or plasma arc.
This heading also covers water-jet cutting machines described in Part (H) below.
This heading, however, excludes the following kinds of machines, which are provided for in heading 84.86 :
(i) Machines for working any material by removal of material, of a kind used solely or principally for the manufacture of semiconductor boules or wafers, semiconductor devices, electronic integrated circuits or flat panel displays.
(ii) Machines for working any material by removal of material, of a kind used solely or principally for the manufacture or repair of masks and reticles.
(iii) Machines for dry-etching patterns on semiconductor materials.
Examples of the foregoing products are (1) laser-beam machine tools which drill semiconductor crystals and (2) ultrasonic process machine-tools which cut semiconductor chips or which cut or drill ceramic substrates for integrated circuits.
(A) MACHINE-TOOLS FOR WORKING BY LASER OR OTHER LIGHT
OR PHOTON BEAM PROCESSES
Laser-beam machining (photonic machining) consists of bombarding a target with photons. This group covers, in particular, machines for drilling (metals, rubies for watches, etc.), machines for cutting metals or other hard materials and machines for engraving (figures, letters, lines, etc.) on various highly resistant materials.
The principle of the machine-tools operated by laser processes is the removal of material by melting, burning or vaporization (also referred to as “ablation”), which are caused by a focused intense laser beam directed at the workpiece. In certain machinetools of this type, the laser beam may be coupled into a low-pressure water jet, which is used to guide the laser beam, and to remove debris and cool the material.
The other machine-tools of this group differ from the machine-tools operated by laser beam processes by the type of beam used for the removal of material.
(B) MACHINE-TOOLS FOR WORKING
BY ULTRASONIC PROCESSES
Ultrasonic machine tools consist of a punch subjected to ultrasonic vibrations and an abrasive in suspension in a liquid. These machines may incorporate an abrasive recycling system.
This group includes machine tools which are used, in particular :
(1) For working diamond or metal carbide dies;
(2) For drilling or shaping minerals;
(3) For engraving glass;
(4) For milling, broaching or polishing.
(C) MACHINE-TOOLS FOR WORKING
BY ELECTRO-DISCHARGE PROCESSES
The principle of this type of machining is the removal of metal between two metallic electrodes (the workpiece and the tool) by sudden electrical discharges of very short duration at the rate of several hundred thousand cycles per second. This group covers, for example, high frequency electric spark cutting machines.
(D) MACHINE-TOOLS FOR WORKING
BY ELECTRO-CHEMICAL PROCESSES
The principle of this type of machining is the removal of metal by electrolysis. The workpiece (anode) is a conductor of electricity as is the tool (cathode). Both are submerged in a selected electrolyte which makes cathodic deposition impossible, and all that occurs is anodic dissolution.
This group includes :
(1) Electrolytic polishing apparatus, used for polishing specimens for microscopic or metallurgical examination.
(2) Electrolytic sharpeners for sharpening cutting tools, cutting chip breaker grooves or cutting metal carbide plates; these machines utilise a diamond wheel.
(3) Machines for deburring various kinds of gear wheel by anodic dissolution.
(4) Machines for precision finishing flat surfaces, etc.
(E) MACHINE TOOLS FOR WORKING
BY ELECTRON BEAM PROCESSES
Electron beam machining consists of bombarding the workpiece on a very small surface with electrons emitted by a cathode, accelerated by an intense electrical field, and focussed by a system of magnetic or electrostatic lenses.
(F) MACHINE-TOOLS FOR WORKING
BY IONIC-BEAM PROCESSES
The beam of these machine tools works by continuous action, not by impulses as in the case of the laser beam.
(G) MACHINE-TOOLS FOR WORKING
BY PLASMA ARC PROCESSES
Plasma arc machining involves intense ionisation of a gas by means of an electric current produced by a magnetic impulse generator under high tension. It permits cutting plates at a very high speed and rough cutting and machining coarse feeding threads.
(H) WATER-JET CUTTING MACHINES
This group includes water-jet and water-abrasive jet cutting machines. These are machines designed to cut materials by a process using streams of water or of water mixed with very fine abrasives, typically at a velocity of 2 to 3 times the speed of sound. They operate under pressures of 3,000 to 4,000 bars and are capable of making multiple types of precision cuts in a variety of materials. Water-jet cutting machines are typically used for softer materials (foam, soft rubber, gasket material, foils, etc.). Water-abrasive jet cutting machines are typically used for harder materials (tool steel, hard rubber, composites, stone, glass, aluminium, stainless steel, etc.).
PARTS AND ACCESSORIES
Subject to the general provisions regarding the classification of parts (see the General Explanatory Note to Section XVI), parts and accessories of the machines of this heading are classified in heading 84.66.
The heading also excludes :
(a) Ultrasonic apparatus for cleaning (heading 84.79).
(b) Soldering, brazing or welding machines and apparatus, whether or not capable of cutting (heading 85.15).
(c) Testing machines (heading 90.24)."
56,8457,"84.57 Machining centres, unit construction machines (single station) and multi station transfer machines, for working metal.
8457.10 - Machining centres
8457.20 Unit construction machines (single station)
8457.30 Multi station transfer machines
This heading applies (see Note 4 to this Chapter) only to machine tools for working metal (other than lathes (including turning centres)) which can carry out different types of machining operations on a single workpiece either :
(a) by automatic tool change from a magazine or the like in conformity with a machining programme (machining centres);
(b) by the automatic use, simultaneously or sequentially, of different unit heads working on a fixed position workpiece (unit construction machines, single station); or
(c) by the automatic transfer of the workpiece to different unit heads (multi station transfer machines).
(A) MACHINING CENTRES
Machining centres are individual machines, i.e., all the machining operations are performed on a single (multi function) machine. These centres must satisfy two conditions : they must carry out several machining operations and they must have automatic tool change, from a magazine or the like in conformity with a machining programme.
Consequently, this group covers machine tools which carry out two or more machining operations by automatic tool change from a magazine or the like, whereas machine tools which carry out one machining operation using a single tool or several tools working simultaneously or sequentially (for example, multiple spindle drills or multiple cutter milling machines) are classified in headings 84.59 to 84.61.
The automatic tool change requirement excludes from the heading multi function machines (for example, machines which drill, bore, tap and mill) in which the various tools are not changed automatically. Such machines are to be classified in headings 84.59 to 84.61 in accordance with Note 3 to Section XVI or by application of Interpretative Rule 3 (c) unless, of course, they can be regarded as multi station transfer machines, in which the workpiece is automatically transferred to the different unit heads (see Part (C) below).
Machining centres may also include auxiliary devices such as pallet changers, systems of pallet magazines or tool magazine changers.
(B) UNIT CONSTRUCTION MACHINES (SINGLE STATION)
Unit construction (single station) machines are multi function machines in which the workpiece is held in a fixed position while the unit heads move relative to the workpiece to carry out the operation or the machine operations.
The unit heads are parts of the machines on which they are mounted and are used to hold, guide and actuate (rotate, advance, retract) the interchangeable tool. Rotating heads usually incorporate an electric motor, while translation heads usually incorporate a hydraulic cylinder : these two types of head may be combined.
This group covers unit construction machines (single station) carrying out two or more machining operations with the use of two or more unit heads.
However, machines carrying out one machining operation with the use of several unit heads or those carrying out several machining operations with the use of a single unit head are excluded.
(C) MULTI STATION TRANSFER MACHINES
The machines of this group must satisfy three conditions : they must carry out several machining operations, they must work by the automatic transfer of the workpiece to the tool and they must be equipped with various unit heads.
A distinction is generally made between rotary transfer machines and linear transfer machines. In the former, the unit heads which perform the various operations are arranged in a circle on a common base. The workpiece travels around the circle in such a way that, at each stop (station), it is worked on by the tools of the corresponding unit head (for example, drilling, boring, tapping). In linear transfer machines, the unit heads are arranged in a line on a common base and work successively on the workpiece as it travels from one head to another, along the line.
In accordance with Chapter Note 4 (c) this heading does not cover transfer lines consisting of various machines linked by a conveyor carrying the workpieces.
Under the terms of the above mentioned Chapter Note, this heading also excludes “flexible manufacturing systems” (FMS) which consist of several machines, generally numerically controlled, or several groups of machines, together with automatic handling facilities such as lifting frames, conveyors, unmanned trolleys, manipulators and industrial robots, for conveying the workpieces to the machines or removing them after machining. The various groups of machines and the handling facilities which constitute the flexible manufacturing system are controlled by automatic data processing machines.

The heading includes :
(1) Lathes, whether or not automatic, including slide lathes, vertical lathes, capstan or turret lathes, production (or copying) lathes. However, spinning lathes which function by deforming the metal are classified in heading 84.63.

Subheading Explanatory Note.
Subheadings 8458.11 and 8458.91
Numerically controlled machine-tools are, as a group, know by their abbreviations CNC (Computer Numerical Control) or NC (Numerical Control). The terms “Computer Numerical Control” and “Numerical Control” can be regarded as synonymous. To qualify as a numerically controlled machine-tool, the functions and movements of the machine-tool, tool or workpiece must be performed according to pre-programmed instructions. The programming is normally executed in an NC-specific language, for example, ISO-code. Programs and other data are stored in order to be accessible directly or subsequently. Numerically controlled machine-tools always integrate a control unit (separate “stand alone” unit or built in), incorporating an automatic data processing machine or a microprocessor, as well as servo systems, in order to achieve the desired motions of the machine-tool, tool or workpiece. CNC-machines, CNC-lathes and NC-milling machines are examples of numerically controlled machine-tools.
If the control unit is not presented with the machine-tool, the latter is nevertheless to be considered as a numerically controlled machine-tool provided it has the specific characteristics of this type of machine."

This heading covers machine tools for drilling, boring, milling, threading or tapping by removing metal, other than lathes (including turning centres) of heading 84.58.
In general machine-tools are power driven but similar machines, worked by hand or pedal, are also covered by this heading. These latter types can be distinguished from the hand tools of heading 82.05 and from the tools for working in the hand of heading 84.67, by the fact that they are usually designed to be mounted on the floor, on a bench, on a wall or on another machine, and are thus usually provided with a base plate, mounting frame, stand, etc.
This heading covers :
(1) Way-type unit head machines. These machines, which are designed to perform drilling, boring, milling, threading or tapping operations, have no attached base. They consist only of a “frame” holding a motor and a tool holder and are equipped with guides (ways) and can therefore move back and forth repetitively when placed on a suitable base. The workpiece is inserted in a work holder independent of the way-type unit head machine which moves back and forth horizontally for drilling, boring, etc.
(2) Drilling machines. These are used for cutting cylindrical holes, including recessed holes, in articles by means of a rotating tool called a drill or bit. The article remains immobile during the working of the tool which is rotated (cutting action) or fed into the work (feed action). This heading also covers drilling machines which employ a fixed tool to work a rotating article, or like machines using both processes.
Drilling machines include single spindle machines, radial or otherwise, and machines with several spindles (multi spindle drilling machines).
(3) Boring machines. These further work the internal surface of an existing hole to exact dimensions. Boring may be cylindrical, conical or spherical. Boring machines are used, for example, for working to exact dimensions the cylinder bores of piston engines or pumps.
The operation of boring involves the use of free standing facing tools with fixed dimensions (borer drills, straight or helically-fluted finishing borers) or variable dimensions (expanding-end borers, inset strip borers, micrometrically adjustable boring heads, boring heads with inset cutters) or with tools working on a guideway (adjustable, expanding or non-adjustable cutters and hollow one-piece sleeves or sleeves with inset parts).
This heading includes, inter alia, vertical boring machines, horizontal boring machines (with fixed or moveable mounting), multiple boring machines, boring machines for duplicating the interiors of hollow-bored shafts as well as machines commonly called miller-borers fitted with a composite spindle made up of two concentric spindles which may function independently; the interior spindle consists of a long sleeve allowing the attachment of a boring bar (spindle borer), while the external spindle, generally coupled to a plate in a rigid manner, is adapted for fitting with a milling cutter (milling spindle).
This heading also covers those machines designed and built essentially for boring, even if they are adapted for carrying out other additional operations (for example, drilling, surfacing, milling, turning and sometimes even screw cutting). On the other hand, lathes (including turning centres) which carry out boring as an auxiliary or additional operation are classified in heading 84.58.
(4) Milling machines. These work a plane or profile surface by means of rotating tools (known as milling cutters), the circular cutting movement is combined with a traversing movement of the article fixed on the machine table. Milling machines include, inter alia, horizontal milling machines, vertical milling machines, horizontal vertical milling machines, milling machines with adjustable heads, plane milling machines, universal milling machines which, in addition to the normal milling work, can by means of a dividing head mounted on the machine, mill splines in a shaft, or spur or helical gears, repetitive milling machines, milling machines for grooving or chamfering, engraving millers.
(5) Tapping machines (i.e., machines to produce a screw thread in an existing hole) and threading machines for threading bolts, screws, etc. It should be noted that thread milling machines are regarded as milling machines.

This heading covers certain surface-finishing machines for metal or cermets, but excludes gear cutting, gear grinding or gear finishing machines (heading 84.61). These machines work by removing material by means of grinding stones, abrasives or polishing products. For the purposes of this heading the expression “polishing products” means the following :
(1) polishing discs made from metal carbides, steel, soft metal, wood, felt, textile material or leather;
(2) wire brushes;
(3) polishing pads.
In general machine-tools are power driven but similar machines, worked by hand or pedal, are also covered by this heading. These latter types can be distinguished from the hand tools of heading 82.05 and from the tools for working in the hand of heading 84.67, by the fact that they are usually designed to be mounted on the floor, on a bench, on a wall or on another machine, and are thus usually provided with a base plate, mounting frame, stand, etc.
The heading includes :
(1) Deburring machines with metal brushes or abrasives, for trimming rough castings or the rough edges of cut metal.
(2) Sharpening machines (tool and cutter grinding machines) including machines for grinding cermets or hard metal tool tips as well as card sharpening machines.
(3) Grinding machines, of different types (e.g., internal surface grinders, centreless surface grinders, surface grinding machines, thread grinding machines, machines for grinding valves and valve seats) whose function is to perfect, to the desired degree of precision, the work of other machines.
This group includes, for example :
(i) Centreless grinding machines. These machines are characterised by the absence of a spindle and the presence of two grinding wheels (an abrasive wheel and a regulating wheel) and of a support blade holding the workpiece.

The heading covers machine-tools working by removing metal or cermets, not elsewhere specified or included.
In general machine-tools are power-driven but similar machines, worked by hand or pedal, are also covered by this heading. These latter types can be distinguished from the hand tools of heading 82.05 and from the tools for working in the hand of heading 84.67, by the fact that they are usually designed to be mounted on the floor, on a bench, on a wall or on another machine, and are thus usually provided with a base plate, mounting frame, stand, etc.
The heading includes :
(1) Planing machines which are for working the external plane or sectional surfaces of an article with the help of tools with a single cutting edge. These are machine tools in which the tool is fixed while the table holding the article to be planed moves with a reciprocating planar motion. However, certain large planing machines such as pit planing machines or plate edge planers have a fixed table and are used for working articles of a great length (e.g., rails).
Some planing machines are fitted with one or two auxiliary or additional milling machine carriages, which replace an equal number of planing carriages. These machine tools called “planing and milling machines” are considered as planing machines, even though it is possible by reducing the speed of the table to use them for milling work. They must not be confused with some milling machines called “plano milling machines” of heading 84.59, the appearance of which is similar to that of a planing machine, but which are equipped only with milling carriages.
Planing machines may also possess one or two grinding slides in addition to planing carriages. The addition of these grinding heads allows these planing machines to be used as table surface trueing machines. Some models are fitted at one and the same time with planing carriages, milling carriages and grinding slides, while others are fitted with devices to allow them to carry out slotting work.
(2) Shaping machines which are machine tools operating on the planing principle and which can be differentiated from planing machines by the fact that the article to be worked is fixed during the cut, while the tool moves with a reciprocating linear movement. Because of the overhang of the tool holder, its maximum run is limited and for this reason the shaping machine is usually restricted to working articles of small dimensions.
(3) Slotting machines which are machine-tools operating by the planing method in which the article to be worked is immobile during the cut, while the tool is moved with a reciprocating linear movement in vertical or sometimes inclined direction. These machines, by reference to use, are slotting tools which are machines characterised by their short slide stroke; slotting-punching machines for carrying out the work necessary for the rapid removal of considerable quantities of material from an extra thick article. These machines use either slide tools (with a single cutting edge), or a punching tool (with four cutting edges); vertical slotting machines; slotting with transverse displacement slide; machines called “grooving machines” (by pulling or pushing), the working process of which resembles that of broaching machines the difference being the tool used.
(4) Broaching machines. The tool (the broach) is pulled or pushed across the work or through a hole, for surface working or shaping. Among the different types of broaching machines are horizontal or vertical machines with simple slide; double machines (“duplex”) which consist of two slides each working on one broach or broaching presses which are vertical machines working on the broach by pressure.
(5) Gear-cutting, gear-grinding and gear-finishing machines. This heading covers gear-cutting machines designed exclusively for making gears by removing metal from cylindrical or conical blanks.
Gear-cutting machines work principally according to the following processes :
module-controlled milling-cutting in which a milling disc or conical cutter is used as a tool. This process is currently used for cutting spur gearing;
reproduction cutting in which the teeth are produced by a planing tool (straight cutting tool). This process is for bevel gear cutting and cylindrical gear-cutting;
cutting by meshing, using a tool such as a worm hob, a rack cutting tool (or chasing tool) or a pinion tool (for circular cutter). This process allows internal or external straight or helical and conical gears to be worked;
abrasive cutting.
(6) Sawing machines. Depending on the form of tool used, the following machines on this type can be distinguished :
reciprocating sawing machines or oscillating sawing machines in which the tool consists of a straight toothed blade which moves with a reciprocating linear movement;
circular saws, which employ a circular tool, toothed on its outer edge and turning at great speed. This tool is commonly called a “slitting saw blade” or “slotting saw blade”;
bandsaw sawing machines, which use a very long blade, one side of which is toothed and the ends of the blade are joined to form a band.
(7) Cutting-off machines. These machine-tools differ from sawing machines by virtue of the tools they use. The latter can be either cutting tools analogous to lathe tools, or abrasive or metal discs.
cutting-off machines with cutting tools employ either of two methods.
One type works in the same way as slide lathes but is distinguishable from them by the fact that the tool holders cannot be moved lengthwise, unlike the saddles of slide lathes.
The other type works like a spindle or axle turning machine in which the tool itself is fixed while the article to be worked moves on a carriage. It is distinguishable from the latter, however, by the fact that the article to be worked can only be moved in one direction.
Both the above types can only carry out one cutting off operation.
Those which work like slide lathes consist of a hollow spindle of large diameter which works on the rotating articles. A very short bed supports one or two tool holders which can be moved transversely. In those which work like a spindle or axle turning machine, the article to be cut is fixed on a carriage which enables it to be moved. The tool itself is fixed on the machine and consists of a crown turning at high speed on which cutting tools are arranged in rings;
cutting-off machines with abrasive discs have a construction similar to those of circular saws, but the slitting saw blade is replaced by a double-edged abrasive wheel;
cutting-off machines with metal discs, also known as friction sawing machines, are characterised by the fact that they operate by means of a mild steel disc with a toothless periphery. This disc, which may be fluted, is rotated in such a way as to give it a peripheral speed such that if the periphery of the disc is gradually brought in close proximity to a piece of metal, the latter immediately melts without having close contact with the disc. This phenomenon is the result of friction combined with the oxidising action of the air trapped between the disc and the metal to be cut.
(8) Filing machines, which are of similar design to reciprocating sawing machines but which use a file rather than a blade.
(9) Engraving machines, other than those of heading 84.59 or 84.60.

The heading covers certain machine-tools, listed in the heading text, which work by changing the shape or form of metal or metal carbides.
In general machine-tools are power-driven but similar machines, worked by hand or pedal, are also covered by this heading. These latter types can be distinguished from the hand tools of heading 82.05 and from the tools for working in the hand of heading 84.67, by the fact that they are usually designed to be mounted on the floor, on a bench, on a wall or on another machine, and are thus usually provided with a base plate, mounting frame, stand, etc.
The heading includes :
1. Hot forming machines for forging, die forging (including presses) and hot hammers. Broadly speaking forging includes all processes for working heated metal by impact or by pressure, either to eliminate puddling slag (shingling) or to shape the metal. Except in the case of shingling where the metal is worked in the form of balls, the metal to be shaped is either in the form of semi-finished products such as blooms, billets or sheet bars, or in the form of bars and rods, usually of circular section.
In the process of die forging, the dies completely enclose the workpiece. In certain cases, however, a single metal die operating on only one part of the unworked piece is used. This is called open-die forging.
Die cutting machines can eliminate the “flash” produced during die forging. This trimming operation is carried out with the aid of special cutting dies.
The finishing operation to produce the necessary precise dimensions of the workpiece, carried out with a precision die, is described as “sizing” or “calibrating”.
The following are examples of machine-tools specially designed and built for carrying out the operations described above :
(a) Closed die forging machines :
Closed die forging is the process in which dies move towards each other and cover the workpiece in whole or in part. The heated raw material, which normally is a sawed or cropped round or square billet, is placed in the bottom die. The shape of the forging is incorporated in the top or bottom die as a negative image. Coming from above, the impact of the top die on the raw material forms it into the required forged form.
(b) Open die forging machines :
Open die forging is the process of deforming a piece of metal between a hammer or ram and a single open die in a multiple step forming procedure until the final shape is achieved.
(c) Hammers, drop forges and drop hammers (mechanical, hydraulic or pneumatic hammers and steam hammers), which operate by a series of short, sharp shocks.
(d) Metal working presses, which operate by continuous pressure. However, general purpose presses not specially designed for metal working are excluded (heading 84.79).
2. Bending, folding, straightening or flattening machines (including press brakes) for flat products.
These products include, inter alia :
(a) Profile forming machines are machines that are used for the automated and continuous production of metal profiles from flat products. A flat metal sheet is passed through several roller sets mounted on consecutive stands. The flat sheet is gradually cross-folded by each of the roller systems until the desired section profile is obtained. Profile forming machines modify the cross section of the metal sheet, while the longitudinal axis remains linear.
(b) Numerically controlled press brakes for flat products are machines for bending metal sheet and plate in an automated and programmable manner. Typically, two C-frames form the sides of the press brake, connected to a table at the bottom and a moveable beam at the top. The bottom tool is mounted on the table and the top tool is mounted on the upper beam. The sheet is curved by a controlled lowering of the press beam. The flat sheet is pressed into a lower tool by an upper tool in a V-die and re-modelled in a straight line.
(c) Numerically controlled panel benders for flat products are machines for the cold forming of flat metal sheets, designed to produce metal products from blanks in an automated and programmable manner. Panel benders are machines loosely similar to press brakes in concept but with a high level of automation, used to mass produce products from sheets of metal. They are capable of bending the metal sheet in two directions without having to move it, which is impossible for press brakes where the piece has to be inverted.
(d) Numerically controlled roll forming machines for flat products are machines for bending operations in which a metal sheet or plate is passed through a set of three or more rolls, until the desired path (arc, circle, oval) of the longitudinal axis of the sheet or plate is obtained in an automated and programmable manner. Roll forming machines modify the curvature of the longitudinal axis of the metal sheet, while the cross section is left unchanged. Roll forming machines, passing products through roller systems, give them the required profile, in which the change in the structure of the metal occurs not over the entire area of the metal, but in places of deformation only as a result of bending.
(e) Folding machines, the working of flat products consists of giving a sheet (or strip) in a straight line a permanent deformation of small radius, without rupturing the metal. This operation is carried out, either on a universal folding machine, or on a folding press.
(f) Straightening machines and flattening machines for remedying imperfections in flat products, such as sheets or strip, arising during their manipulation after manufacture. For example, flattening machines of the roller type, which consist of a series of parallel rollers (or cylinders), either small in number (5 to 11) but of relatively large diameter and great rigidity, or large in number (generally 15 to 23) but of small diameter, great flexibility, and supported by an equal number of counter rollers.
3. Slitting lines, cut-to-length lines and other shearing machines (excluding presses) for flat products, other than combined punching and shearing machines.
These products include, inter alia :
(a) Slitting lines for flat products are processing lines where two cylindrical rolls with matching ribs and grooves are used to cut a large roll of metal into a number of narrower rolls or rolls with cut edges. The basic parts of a slitting line are: an uncoiler, a coil flattener, a slitter and a recoiler. The material is fed from the uncoiler, and is first flattened and then fed through the nip between the two cutting wheels (one on top and another underneath). The slit pieces are then taken up by various recoilers at the end of the line.
(b) Cut-to-length lines for flat products are processing lines where a shear is used to cut long flat rolled or coiled metal into multiple sheets. Cut-to-length lines consist of three main parts: an uncoiler, a coil flattener, and a shear. The material is fed from the uncoiler through the coil flattener and cut by a shear into flat sheets of metal.
(c) Shearing machines. The shearing process involves two cutting tools with faces in the same plane applied vertically to the metal to be cut. These tools penetrate the metal which is subjected to plastic deformation and the fibres of which, under progressively more and more pressure and penetration, rupture along the line of the blades.
Machines of this type include : balance shears, lever shears and guillotine shears which use blades; rotary shearing machines which, instead of blades, use tools in the form of discs or frustums of cones.
4. Punching, notching or nibbling machines (excluding presses) for flat products including combined punching and shearing machines.
These products include, inter alia :
(a) Punching machines used for perforating, notching or cutting metal by means of two tools adjusted one inside the other. The punching tool is called the punch while the other is called the die. Rupture of the metal is effected as in shearing and the shape of the hole obtained depends on the shape of the tools.
The different machines of this type include machines for making gears by punching.
A punching machine works very differently than a press. Punching machines operate incrementally, along a given trajectory in cutting a piece of sheet metal, a process also known as nibbling. In contrast to this, punching as part of a die forging or die cutting operation cuts sheet metal with a single stroke of the dies.
(b) Notching machines are small machines used for working various sections (L, T, I or U sections) and half-rounds, either to prepare them for assembly (for example, grooves, slots, tenons and dovetails), or simply to cut or pierce them.
5. Machines for working tube, pipe, hollow section and bar (excluding presses).
These products include, inter alia :
Machines that perform operations on metal tube, pipe, profile, hollow section and bar in order to alter the shape of the processed material without chips removal. Such operations may include bending, folding, end-finishing, straightening, flattening, punching (without the removal of meatl), and tube hydroforming, as well as the working of tube, pipe, profile, hollow section and bars (excluding presses), other than draw benches (heading 84.63).
Bending machines work either by means of forming rollers, by press bending or, for tubes (and, in particular, oil pipes), by drawing their ends while the main section is held by a fixed cylinder.
Folding machines work by folding bars, rods, tubes, angles, shapes and sections in a manner akin to forming (see item 2 (c) above).
Wire bending machines add curvature to single planes. Wire bending machines that carry out more complex operations (for example, spring manufacturing machines) do not constitute simple folding machines and fall in heading 84.63.
6. Cold metal working presses :
These products include, inter alia :
(a) Hydraulic presses :
Hydraulic presses are machines using a high pressure fluid to drive, by a piston, the moving element of the machine to generate the force needed to move the beam of the press, to which the tools or die are mounted that change the shape of the material.
Hydraulic presses can be controlled either numerically or non-numerically. In contrast to mechanical or servo presses, the travel of a hydraulic press is freely adjustable and any intermediate position of the press beam can be realized without changing the kinematic setup of the machine.
(b) Mechanical presses :
Mechanical presses are machines using an electrical motor to generate a compressive force through a kinematic chain. These presses are designed or intended to mechanically transfer energy from a primary motor to a tool using a clutch mechanism that transmits torque to generate movement from the wheel to the runner. The shape of the metal workpiece is changed by the substantial pressure placed on it.
Mechanical presses can be controlled either numerically or non-numerically. They have an electrical motor and use a clutch-based mechanism to reverse the motion.
(c) Servo-presses :
Servo-presses are machines using, typically, a kinematic system driven by a servo-motor to generate a compressive force to change the shape of a metal workpiece. These presses are designed to mechanically transfer energy to a tool by means of a servo-drive, without a clutch mechanism, to generate torque to power the device.
Servo-presses are a special type of mechanical presses (usually screw driven). Their main characteristic is related to the management of the motion, which is performed directly by the servo-drive, while in certain other mechanical presses, the motion is controlled by the setup of the mechanical hardware, resulting in lower flexibility with respect to adjusting the travel of the press beam.
(d) Extruding presses for extruding bars, rods, angles, shapes, sections, tubes, etc. These presses are designed to force a mass of metal through an extrusion die with the help of a punch.
(e) Presses for compressing metal scrap into bales

8464.10 Sawing machines
8464.20 Grinding or polishing machines
8464.90 Other
In general machine-tools are power-driven but similar machines, worked by hand or pedal, are also covered by this heading. These latter types can be distinguished from the hand tools of heading 82.05 and from the tools for working in the hand of heading 84.67, by the fact that they are usually designed to be mounted on the floor, on a bench, on a wall or on another machine, and are thus usually provided with a base plate, mounting frame, stand, etc.
(I) MACHINES FOR WORKING STONE, CERAMICS, CONCRETE, ASBESTOS-CEMENT OR LIKE MINERAL MATERIALS
This group covers not only machines for working natural stone, but also those for working similar hard materials (ceramics, concrete, artificial stone, asbestos-cement, etc.). Although most machines for working precious or semi precious stones have special features (higher precision, etc.), they are nevertheless classified in this heading.
The heading includes :
(A) Sawing or cutting machines, such as :
(1) Sawing machines proper (circular saws, band saws and reciprocating saws, including those using toothless blades, etc.).
(2) Disc (e.g., abrasive) cutting machines, including machines for grooving or cutting false joints on concrete surfaces or on the face of building stone.
(3) Helical wire cutting machines. These operate by means of an endless steel wire consisting of several spirally twisted strands, and guided by a system of grooved pulleys. The wire, assisted by an abrasive mixture of powdered sandstone and water, cuts into the stone by friction.

(II) MACHINE TOOLS
FOR COLD WORKING GLASS
This category covers machine tools used for cold working glass, but it excludes machines used for hot working glass (i.e., glass heated until it becomes fluid or plastic) (heading 84.75). Nevertheless, the fact that in some cases the glass is slightly heated to facilitate certain processes does not exclude the machines from this heading, since they are working on glass which still retains the consistency of a hard material.
Many of these machines carry out operations similar to those mentioned in paragraph (I) above in connection with stone or the like.
Others, on the other hand, are employed for more specific work, e.g., decorative finishing, or for certain specialised uses (e.g., optical or watch-making). The following, in particular, fall in this latter category :
(1) Glass cutting machines, of the wheel or diamond type.
(2) Glass cutting (shaping) machines, for facetting, or for cut glass articles.
(3) Trueing, grinding, etc., machines, used mainly for smoothing edges, levelling bases or trimming moulded objects.
(4) Polishing machines. Polishing is sometimes followed by a still more specialised finishing process, known as smoothing, executed by felt disc machines; such machines also fall in this heading.
(5) Engraving machines of the grinding wheel or diamond type; sand jet engraving machines are, however, excluded (heading 84.24).
(6) Machine-tools used for finishing or polishing optical, spectacle or clock or watch glass. These include the special circular glass-cutter which is used to cut out eye-pieces for spectacles, and also machines for shaping or polishing optical glass by wearing down the surface of lenses, prisms, spectacle lenses (spherical, ring shaped, cylindrical, multi focus, etc.), etc.

The heading excludes machines for working materials which although referred to in the heading do not possess the characteristics of hard materials at the time work commences on them. For this reason, machines for cutting or slicing supple plastics or unhardened rubber are excluded (heading 84.77). Furthermore, the heading does not cover machines for making articles from granules or powder, such as machines for moulding plastic materials (heading 84.77), machines for agglomerating or moulding particles or fibres of wood or other ligneous matter (heading 84.79) or other similar machines. Although they might be considered to be for the treatment of the materials mentioned in the heading, the heading also excludes, in general, machines and apparatus whose function is not to work the material or its surface, e.g., those for the drying of wood or the ageing of it by desiccation (heading 84.19), machines for the expansion of cork (heading 84.19) or machines for compressing, agglomerating or impregnating wood (heading 84.79).
In general, machine tools are power driven but similar machines, worked by hand or pedal, are also covered by this heading. These latter types can be distinguished from the hand tools of heading 82.05 and from the tools for working in the hand of heading 84.67, by the fact that they are usually designed to be mounted on the floor, on a bench, on a wall or on another machine, and are thus usually provided with a base plate, mounting frame, stand, etc.
(A) MACHINES NOT NORMALLY SPECIALISED
FOR A PARTICULAR INDUSTRY
This group includes :
(1) Sawing machines of all types. They operate by means of blades or chains generally provided with teeth. They include :
(a) Sawing machines with reciprocating tools, e.g., log cross-cut sawing machines with right-toothed blades, fret saws and vertical or horizontal frame saws for cutting rough timber into planks.
(b) Sawing machines whose tool revolves. These include chain saws and band saws such as vertical and horizontal band saws, quartering and halving band saws, chariot or table band saws and various specialised machines such as multiple band saws for making blocks, strips, friezes, etc., for wood flooring and band saws for the paper industry.
(c) Sawing machines whose tool has a rotating motion. This large group includes all machines which cut by means of one or more toothed blades moving in a circular movement. It includes, for example, pendulum saws, cut off saws with a straight line tool stroke, radial saws, block stroke saws with longitudinal cut, circular log-cutting saws, edging circular saws, bench saws, sliding table saws, circular panel cutting saws.
(2) Moulding and planing machines, which prepare the surface of the workpiece using blades which remove chips of the material. These include machines which work on one or two surfaces and planing machines which can work on up to all four surfaces.

This group also includes CNC milling mlachines.
(4) Machining centres (see Subheading Note 1 to this Chapter), also known as CNC work centres. These machines carry out several machining operations and have automatic tool change, from a magazine or the like in conformity with a machining programme. Consequently, this group covers machine tools which carry out two or more machining operations by automatic tool change from a magazine or the like, whereas machine tools which carry out one machining operation using a single tool or several tools working simultaneously or sequentially (for example, multiple spindle drills or multiple cutter milling machines) remain classified in their respective subheadings as drilling or milling machines.
(5) Grinding, sanding and polishing machines. Grinding machines which use grindstones are principally used for hard products such as corozo, hard rubber, horn and ivory.
Sanding machines use abrasives to improve the surface finish as well as the dimensional accuracy of the workpiece. This group includes those with an oscillating action, belt sanders, disc sanders, bobbin and drum sanders. Machines known as smoothing machines are also in this group.
Polishing machines impart a lustre, by means of bands, drums or flexible rollers, to a workpiece previously given a smooth finish.
(6) Bending machines which mechanically change the form or physical characteristics of the workpiece by action on its structure.
(7) Assembling machines.
These include :
(a) Machines which assemble two or more parts by means of binding agents, adhesives or gummed paper. This group includes veneer splicing machines, plank glueing machines, panel forming machines, frame clamps, carcase clamps, plywood and laminating wood presses, veneering presses. These machines may incorporate devices for spreading glue on the surface of the wood.
(b) Machines which join, using nails, staples, wire, etc.
(c) Machines for joining without binding agents or fasteners, e.g., squeeze presses.
(8) Drilling machines. These are used solely to drill a circular hole using a rotating tool (spindle or bit). The centre of the tool and of the hole to be drilled are along a common axis. This group includes single and multiple drilling spindle machines, knot hole drilling machines and dowel hole drilling machines. CNC drilling machines also belong to this group.
(9) Morticing machines. These cut non-cylindrical holes using a chisel, a mortice chain or routing bit, e.g., slot, chisel or chain morticing machines.
(10) Splitting, stamping, fragmenting, paring and slicing machines. All these machines transform a workpiece mechanically without removing chips of wood.
These include :
(a) Splitting machines which split the fibre bond by wedge action. These include log splitting machines, firewood splitting machines, root splitting machines and willow, bamboo and rattan splitting machines.
(b) Stamping machines which shape by impact cutting, e.g., veneer stamping machines.
(c) Fragmenting machines which produce small pieces of wood of similar size and shape. These include sliver cutting machines, particle producing machines, wood wool making machines and chopping and chipping machines.
However, defibrators for producing wood pulp are excluded and fall in heading 84.39.
(d) Paring or slicing machines which use a straight cutting edge to produce thin sheets either by slicing (machines for making thin boards) or by paring (machines for producing veneers or thin sheets for plywood production).
This group also includes veneer shearing machines which use rectilinear blades, mitre trimming machines and mullion cutting machines.
(11) Lathes, which are used to fashion a workpiece by a motion about its own axis, the tool not turning. This group includes lathes of all kinds, including copying lathes.
(12) Tree delimbing or bucking machines.
(13) Wood de-barking machinery (log decorticators, post peeling machines, etc.), other than water-jet bark strippers of heading 84.24 and barking drums of heading 84.79.
(14) Knot-boring machines for preparing logs (e.g., for use in making paper pulp).
The heading also includes machines which can carry out different types of machining operations without tool change between such operations.
Examples are :
(1) Combined joinery machines having in a single unit several machines with different functions, used independently of each other. With this type of machine it is necessary to give manual assistance to the workpiece between each operation. These include machines for surface planing combined with one or more other operations and sawing-moulding-morticing machines.
(2) Multi-purpose machines in which, unlike the previous group, no further manual assistance is required after the insertion of the workpiece. These include single-end tenoning machines with several spindles, double end tenoning machines, machines for positioning hardware, dowel holes, etc., machines for assembling, using adhesives and finishing (for the production of veneer strips or making panels from laths).
(B) MACHINE TOOLS SPECIALISED
FOR A PARTICULAR INDUSTRY
This group includes :
(1) Cooperage machinery (e.g., stave jointing, stave planing, stave bending, stave croze cutting or cask crozing machines; cask assembly machines; machines for driving the hoops over a cask). But the heading excludes cask or stave steaming apparatus (heading 84.19).

8467.99 Other
This heading covers tools which incorporate an electric motor, a compressed air motor (or compressed air operated piston), an internal combustion motor or any other motor (e.g., small hydraulic turbine); the compressed air motor is generally operated by an external source of compressed air, and in the case of the internal combustion motor the ignition batteries are sometimes separate. In pneumatic tools the action of the compressed air is sometimes supplemented by hydraulic connections.
The heading covers such tools only if for working in the hand. The expression “tools for working in the hand” means tools designed to be held in the hand during use, and also heavier tools (such as earth rammers) which are portable, that is, which can be lifted and moved by hand by the user, in particular while work is in progress, and which are also designed to be controlled and directed by hand during operation. To obviate the fatigue of taking their full weight during operation they may be used with auxiliary supporting devices (e.g., tripods, jacklegs, overhead lifting tackle).
However, certain tools for working in the hand of this heading have fittings permitting them to be temporarily fixed to a support. They remain classified here, together with the support if it is presented therewith, provided the tools are essentially “for working in the hand” as defined above.
Some of the tools covered by this heading may be fitted with auxiliary devices (e.g., a fanwheel and its dust-bag to remove and collect dust during working).
The heading excludes tools which, because of their weight, size, etc., obviously cannot be used in the hand as described above. It also excludes tools (whether or not portable) fitted with a base plate or other device for fixing to the wall, bench, floor, etc., those with provisions for running on rails (e.g., machines for slotting or drilling railway sleepers) and walk-behind or similar hand-directed machines on wheels, e.g., floor grinding machines, for concrete, marble, or wood, etc.
The heading further excludes combinations consisting of a tool holder with one or more tools, and a separate spark-ignition internal combustion piston engine or a separate electric motor with a flexible shaft; the tool holder is classified in heading 84.66, the motor with its flexible shaft in heading 84.07 or 85.01, as the case may be, and the tools in their own appropriate headings.
The tools of this heading include tools for working various materials and are used in various industries.
Subject to the conditions above, the tools of this heading include, inter alia :
(1) Drilling, tapping or reaming machines.
(2) Boring machines, rock drills and the like.

8468.10 Hand-held blow pipes
8468.20 Other gas-operated machinery and apparatus
8468.80 Other machinery and apparatus
8468.90 Parts
The heading covers :
(A) Soldering, brazing or welding machinery and apparatus, whether or not capable of cutting, gas-operated or using processes other than those referred to in the text of heading 85.15. Machines designed exclusively for cutting are classified in their own appropriate headings.
(B) Gas operated surface tempering machines and appliances.
(I) GAS-OPERATED APPLIANCES
FOR WORKING METAL, ETC.
The appliances of this group are operated by means of a very hot flame produced by the combustion of an inflammable gas in a jet of oxygen or air.
In general, these appliances can be used not only for the operations referred to in the heading, but also for other operations requiring a similar high temperature (e.g., preliminary heating for certain operations, or refilling worn parts or cavities with metal); in practice certain appliances are specialised for these other operations, but they remain in this heading provided they operate in the same manner and on the same principle as the other appliances of the heading.
All the appliances of this group have an arrangement for bringing two gases to the nozzle which has two outlets, either concentric or side by side; one of the gases is inflammable (acetylene, butane, propane, coal gas, hydrogen, etc.) and the other compressed air or oxygen.
The heading covers hand operated appliances and also machines.
(A) HAND-OPERATED GAS WELDING, ETC., APPLIANCES
(BLOWPIPES)
Blowpipes are said to be of high-pressure or low-pressure type depending on whether they are designed to be connected to a high or low pressure source of inflammable gas. In the high-pressure type, the compression gives the gas the velocity required to produce the flame jet; with the low pressure type a compressor is necessary.
Both types of blowpipes are otherwise of more or less similar construction. In design, they consist of a handle or body fitted with the supply pipes, at the exit of which (the nozzle) the gas is ignited; they generally also include regulating valves, etc. The apparatus is connected to an external gas supply by flexible tubing.
To enable the appliances to be adapted to the type of work concerned (e.g., to blast furnace tapping, rivet removing, grooving or simple heating) the tubes and nozzles are usually interchangeable (variable aperture nozzles, multiple nozzle orifices, flame-separating nozzles, etc.). Some blowpipes are specially designed for particular operations, e.g., welding blowpipes equipped with a water-cooling system, for heavy work.
(B) MACHINES FOR WELDING, ETC.
These are based on the same principles as the hand-operated appliances in Part (A) above, and consist essentially of fixed or adjustable blowpipes. Other parts of the machine (e.g., feed tables, jaws, slide rests and jointed arms) either enable the part being worked to be fixed, guided or moved forward, or allow the nozzles to be moved or adjusted according to the progress of the work.
(C) SURFACE TEMPERING MACHINES
These consist of a number of nozzles arranged according to the shape of the object to be treated; the flames from these nozzles project on to the surface to be tempered a heat of such intensity that it is rapidly brought to the temperature required, but this heat does not penetrate far below the surface. Once the surface has been brought to the required tempering temperature, sprays of cooling liquid are directed on the article or it is immersed in a bath of the liquid.
(II) GAS-OPERATED APPLIANCES
FOR WELDING THERMOPLASTICS
This heading also includes certain appliances for welding or sealing thermoplastic materials or articles thereof. The appliances of this heading operate by means of a flame or a jet of hot air, nitrogen or inert gas from a welding torch. The air or other gases may be heated by passage through a gas-heated tube.
(III) MACHINERY AND APPARATUS FOR WELDING,
OTHER THAN GAS-OPERATED APPLIANCE
This group includes :
(1) Machinery and mechanical appliances for welding by means of grooved wheels or heated irons, other than hand soldering irons (heading 82.05) and other than electrical apparatus of heading 85.15.
(2) Friction welding machines.

68,8470,"84.70 Calculating machines and pocket-size data recording, reproducing and displaying machines with calculating functions; accounting machines, postage-franking machines, ticket-issuing machines and similar machines, incorporating a calculating device; cash registers.
8470.10 - Electronic calculators capable of operation without an external source of electric power and pocket-size data recording, reproducing and displaying machines with calculating functions
Other electronic calculating machines :
8470.21 Incorporating a printing device
8470.29 Other
8470.30 Other calculating machines
8470.50 Cash registers
8470.90 Other
All machines of this heading, except for certain cash registers, have one common characteristic in that they include a calculating device enabling them to add together at least two figures each comprising several digits. It should be noted that devices which merely count or add one by one are not regarded as calculating devices (e.g., devices incorporated in certain stamp affixing machines, revolution counters, production counters). The machines of this heading may be manually or electrically operated. The calculation operations are performed mechanically or by electro magnetic, electronic or fluidic devices.
(A) CALCULATING MACHINES AND
POCKET-SIZE DATA RECORDING, REPRODUCING AND
DISPLAYING MACHINES WITH CALCULATING FUNCTIONS
This group comprises a wide range of calculating machines varying from the simplest types which can only add and subtract to more complex machines which can perform the four arithmetic operations and several other types of calculations (e.g., extract square roots, raise a number to a given power and carry out trigonometric calculations). It includes, in particular, pocket electronic calculators and office electronic calculators, whether or not programmable. This group also includes pocket-size data recording, reproducing and displaying machines with calculating functions (see Note 8 to this Chapter).
Electronic programmable calculators differ from automatic data processing machines, in particular, by the fact that they cannot execute, without human intervention, a processing program which requires them to modify their execution, by logical decision during the processing run. These calculators incorporate a microprocessor designed to carry out complex mathematical operations.
Calculating machines comprise the following main parts :
(1) Manual arrangements for data input (stops or cursors, keyboard, etc.). However, they may have ancillary facilities for the automatic input of recurrent or preset data (readers for punched cards or tape, magnetic tape, etc.).
(2) A calculating device operated by a series of keys or by a program which may be fixed or may be modified by replacing the programming element or changing the program instructions.
(3) An output device presenting the results in the form of a visual display or a print out. “Printer” machines incorporate a device for printing the result and sometimes also the preliminary data. However, calculating machines remain classified here whether or not comprising such a device.
Calculating machines with a printing facility use numbers and a limited range of symbols. However, they differ from accounting machines in that they print vertically only, on paper bands or rolls. Some have ancillary facilities for recording the results in code on data media.
Some of the components of these machines (calculating device, ancillary devices, etc.) may be built in or be separate units connected by electric cable.
(B) ACCOUNTING MACHINES
These machines are designed to keep accounting books, accounting documents, etc. They combine the function of accounting (i.e., totalling a series of items) with that of printing letters or symbols in addition to figures in order to provide an adequate description of the accounting operation performed.
The structure of accounting machines is appreciably the same as that of calculating machines. In addition to manual input arrangements for variable data (e.g., debit credit operations), like calculating machines they may be fitted with devices for reading punched cards or tape, magnetic tape or cards, etc., to introduce recurrent data (account No., customer’s name and address, etc.) or pre set data (e.g., balance of account).
Accounting machines have numeric or alpha numeric printing devices which can print both vertically and horizontally; this is one of the features which distinguishes them from calculating machines.
In most cases, these machines are designed to be used with specially printed forms such as pay slips, invoices, loose leaf pages of day books, journals, ledgers, etc., or filing cards. Some of them can type simultaneously on two or more forms (e.g., on the invoices and corresponding day book and ledger entries).
They are often equipped with apparatus for transcribing data onto data media in coded form. Some print in clear on a card and simultaneously transcribe the results in code on a magnetic track on the side of the card. These results can then serve as basic data for further processing in the machine.
Like calculating machines, these machines may be in the form of a self contained unit or consist of separate units to be electrically interconnected.
(C) CASH REGISTERS
This group comprises cash registers whether or not incorporating a calculating device.
These machines are used in shops, offices, etc., to provide a record of all transactions (sales, services rendered, etc.) as they occur, of the amounts involved, the total of the amounts recorded and, in some cases, the code number of the article sold, quantity sold, time of transaction, etc.
Data may be introduced either manually by means of a keyboard and a stop, lever or handle, or automatically, e.g., by means of a bar code reader. Like calculating and accounting machines, some cash registers also have ancillary facilities for the automatic input of recurrent or pre set data (e.g., card or tape readers).
Usually, the result is visually displayed and printed, at the same time, on a ticket for the customer and on a tallyroll which is periodically removed from the machine for checking purposes.
These machines are often combined with a till or drawer in which the cash is kept.
They may also incorporate or work in conjunction with devices such as multipliers for increasing their calculating capacity, calculators of change due, automatic change dispensers, trading stamp dispensers, credit card readers, check digit verifiers, or appliances for transcribing all or part of the data on transactions onto data media in coded form. If presented separately, these devices are classified in their respective headings.
This heading also covers cash registers working in conjunction, on line or off line, with an automatic data processing machine and cash registers which use, for example, the memory and microprocessor of another cash register (to which they are linked by cable) to perform the same functions.
This group also includes terminals for electronic payment by credit or debit card. These terminals use the telephone network to connect to the financial institution for authorisation and completion of the transaction, and to record and issue receipts indicating the amounts debited and credited.
(D) OTHER MACHINES
INCORPORATING A CALCULATING DEVICE
These include :
(1) Postage-franking machines; these print on the envelope a design in place of the postage stamp. The machine has a non reversible totalling device which adds up the total value of the postages printed. In addition the machine can often be used for other printing on the envelope (e.g., advertising slogans).
(2) Ticket issuing machines used to issue tickets (e.g., cinema or railway tickets) at the same time recording and totalling the amounts involved; certain of these also print the ticket.
(3) Totalisator machines for racecourses. These issue the tickets, record and total the amounts staked, and in certain complex machines also calculate the odds.
Machines which only count the tickets, etc., issued, without totalising the amounts, are excluded (heading 84.72 or, if coin-operated, heading 84.76).
PARTS AND ACCESSORIES
Subject to the general provisions regarding the classification of parts (see the General Explanatory Note to Section XVI), parts and accessories of machines of this heading are classified in heading 84.73.
The heading does not cover :
(a) Data processing machines of heading 84.71.
(b) Weighing machines which total the weights (heading 84.23 or 90.16).
(c) Slide rules, disc calculators, cylindrical calculators and other calculating instruments based on the slide rule or other mathematical calculating principle including, for instance, pocket type adding and subtracting devices operated by the selection of numbers with a stylus according to a given procedure (heading 90.17).

(I) AUTOMATIC DATA PROCESSING MACHINES
AND UNITS THEREOF
Data processing is the handling of information of all kinds, in pre-established logical sequences and for a specific purpose or purposes.
Automatic data processing machines are machines which, by logically interrelated operations performed in accordance with pre-established instructions (program), furnish data which can be used as such or, in some cases, serve in turn as data for other data processing operations.
This heading covers data processing machines in which the logical sequences of the operations can be changed from one job to another, and in which the operation can be automatic, that is to say with no manual intervention for the duration of the task. These machines mostly use electronic signals but may also use other technologies. They may be self contained, all the elements required for data processing being combined in the same housing, or they may be in the form of systems consisting of a variable number of separate units.
This heading also covers separately presented constituent units of automatic data processing systems described above.
However, the heading excludes machines, instruments or apparatus incorporating or working in conjunction with an automatic data processing machine and performing a specific function. Such machines, instruments or apparatus are classified in the headings appropriate to their respective functions or, failing that, in residual headings (See Part (E) of the General Explanatory Note to this Chapter).
(A) AUTOMATIC DATA PROCESSING MACHINES
The automatic data processing machines of this heading must be capable of fulfilling simultaneously the conditions laid down in Note 6 (A) to this Chapter. That is to say, they must be capable of:
(1) Storing the processing program or programs and at least the data immediately necessary for the execution of the program;
(2) Being freely programmed in accordance with the requirements of the user;
(3) Performing arithmetical computations specified by the user; and
(4) Executing, without human intervention, a processing program which requires them to modify their execution, by logical decision during the processing run.
Thus, machines which operate only on fixed programs, i.e., programs which cannot be modified by the user, are excluded even though the user may be able to choose between a number of such fixed programs.
These machines have storage capability and also stored programs which can be changed from job to job.
Automatic data processing machines process data in coded form. A code consists of a finite set of characters (binary code, standard six bit ISO code, etc.).
The data input is usually automatic, by the use of data media such as magnetic tapes, or by direct reading of original documents, etc. There may also be arrangements for manual input by means of keyboards or the input may be furnished directly by certain instruments (e.g., measuring instruments).
The input data are converted by the input units into signals which can be used by the machine, and stored in the storage units.
Part of the data and program or programs may be temporarily stored in auxiliary storage units such as those using magnetic discs, magnetic tapes, etc. But these automatic data processing machines must have a main storage capability which is directly accessible for the execution of a particular program and which has a capacity at least sufficient to store those parts of the processing and translating programs and the data immediately necessary for the current processing run.
Automatic data processing machines may comprise in the same housing, the central processing unit, an input unit (e.g., a keyboard or a scanner) and an output unit (e.g., a visual display unit), or may consist of a number of interconnected separate units. In the latter case, the units form a “system” when it comprises at least the central processing unit, an input unit and an output unit (see Subheading Note 2 to this Chapter). The interconnections may be made by wired or wireless means.
A complete automatic data processing system must comprise, at least :
(1) A central processing unit which generally incorporates the main storage, the arithmetical and logical elements and the control elements; in some cases, however, these elements may be in the form of separate units.
(2) An input unit which receives input data and converts them into signals which can be processed by the machine.
(3) An output unit which converts the signals provided by the machine into an intelligible form (printed text, graphs, displays, etc.) or into coded data for further use (processing, control, etc.).
Two of these units (input and output units, for example) may be combined in one single unit.
A complete automatic data processing system is classified in this heading, even though one or more units may be classified elsewhere when presented separately (see part (B) Separately presented units, below).
These systems may include remote input or output units in the form of data terminals.
Such systems may also include units, apart from the input or output units, designed to increase the capacity of the system for instance, by expanding one or more of the functions of the central unit (see Part ( B) below). Such units are inserted between the input or output units (start and end of the system), although adapting and converting units (channel adaptors and signal converters) may occasionally be connected before the input unit or after the output unit.
Automatic data processing machines and systems are put to many uses, for example, in industry, in trade, in scientific research and in public or private administrations. (See Part (E) of the General Explanatory Note to Chapter 84 with respect to the classification of machines incorporating or working in conjunction with an automatic data processing machine and performing a specific function (Note 6 (E) to this Chapter)).
(B) SEPARATELY PRESENTED UNITS
Subject to the provisions of Notes 6 (D) and (E) to this Chapter, this heading also covers separately presented constituent units of automatic data processing systems. These may be in the form of units having a separate housing or in the form of units not having a separate housing and designed to be inserted into a machine (e.g., insertion onto the main board of a central processing unit). Constituent units are those defined in Part (A) above and in the following paragraphs, as being parts of a complete system.
An apparatus can only be classified in this heading as a unit of an automatic data processing system if it :
(a) Performs a data processing function;
(b) Meets the following criteria set out in Note 6 (C) to this Chapter :
(i) It is of a kind solely or principally used in an automatic data processing system;
(ii) It is connectable to the central processing unit either directly or through one or more other units; and
(iii) It is able to accept or deliver data in a form (codes or signals) which can be used by the system.
(c) Is not excluded by the provisions of Notes 6 (D) and (E) to this Chapter.
In accordance with the last paragraph of Note 6 (C) to this Chapter, keyboards, X-Y co-ordinate input devices and disc storage units which satisfy the conditions of items (b) (ii) and (iii) above, are in all cases to be classified as constituent units of data processing systems.
If the unit performs a specific function other than data processing, it is to be classified in the heading appropriate to that function or, failing that, in a residual heading (see Note 6 (E) to this Chapter). If an apparatus does not meet the criteria set out in Note 6 (C) to this Chapter, or is not performing a data processing function, it is to be classified according to its characteristics by application of General Interpretative Rule 1, if necessary in combination with General Interpretative Rule 3 (a).
Separately presented appliances such as measuring or checking instruments adapted by the addition of devices (signal converters, for example), which enable them to be connected directly to a data processing machine, are, in particular, not to be regarded as units of an automatic data processing system. Such appliances fall to be classified in their own appropriate heading.
Apart from central processing units and input and output units, examples of other units include :
(1) Additional storage external to the central processing unit (magnetic card transports, magnetic or optical disc storages, tape autoloaders and libraries, optical disc drive libraries (sometimes referred to as “optical disc jukeboxes”), etc.). This group also includes additional data storage devices known as “proprietary storage formats”, whether for internal installation in an automatic data processing machine or for external use with such machines. The devices may be in the form of drives for discs or tapes.
(2) Additions which enhance the processing power of the central processing unit (e.g. floating point processing units).
(3) Control and adaptor units such as those to effect interconnection of the central processing unit to input or output units (e.g., USB hubs). However, control and adaptor units for communication in a wired or wireless network (such as a local or wide area network) are excluded (heading 85.17).
(4) Signal converting units. At input, these enable an external signal to be understood by the machine, while at output, they convert the output signals that result from the processing carried out by the machine into signals which can be used externally.
(5) X-Y co-ordinate input devices, which are units for inputting position data into automatic data processing machines. These devices include the mouse, the light pen, the joystick, the track ball and the touch-sensitive screen. Their common attribute is that their input consists of, or is interpreted as, data indicating position relative to some fixed point. Their common usage is to control the position of the cursor on the display unit, as a replacement for or a complement to the cursor keys on the keyboard.
This category also covers graphic tablets, which are X–Y co-ordinate input devices making it possible to capture and trace the co-ordinates of a curve or any other geometrical form. This apparatus is generally composed of a rectangular board with an active sensing surface, a pointer or pen used to create drawings, and a zoom linked to a cross-piece, making it possible to input data.
This category further covers digitizers, which have similar functions to graphic tablets. However, while graphic tablets are used for creating original art and drawings, as well as for application menu selection and on-screen object control, digitizers are generally used for the capture of existing drawings that exist only in hard-copy form. Digitizer pointing devices may assume any shape, but must be small enough to be hand-held and moved around the (active) sensing region of the digitizer. Cross-hair cursors are the most common shape.
(II) MAGNETIC OR OPTICAL READERS, MACHINES FOR
TRANSCRIBING DATA ONTO DATA MEDIA IN CODED FORM
AND MACHINES FOR PROCESSING SUCH DATA,
NOT ELSEWHERE SPECIFIED OR INCLUDED
This group comprises a wide range of machines, many being electro magnetic or electronic, which usually complement each other and are generally used in systems for compiling statistics or for accounting or other operations. The group includes magnetic or optical readers, machines for transcribing data onto data media in coded form and machines which process data and which decode the result.
The group includes machines only if they are not elsewhere specified or included. It thus excludes, for example :
(a) The automatic data processing machines and units thereof described in Part (I) above, other than bar code readers.
(c) Calculating machines, accounting machines and cash registers of heading 84.70, from which they differ in that they have no manual input arrangements but receive data solely in coded form (magnetic tape, discs, CD-ROMs, etc.).
(c) Automatic typewriters and word-processing machines (heading 84.72).
(A) MAGNETIC OR OPTICAL READERS
Magnetic or optical readers read characters, generally in a special form, and convert them into electric signals (impulses) which can be directly used by machines for transcribing or processing coded information.
(1) Magnetic readers. In this type of appliance, the characters, printed with a special magnetic ink, are magnetised and then converted into electric impulses by a magnetic reader head. They are subsequently identified either by comparison with data registered in the storage units of the machine or by means of a numeric code, usually binary.
(2) Optical readers. These do not require the use of special ink. The characters are read directly by a series of photoelectric cells and translated on the binary code principle. This group also includes bar code readers. These machines generally use photosensitive semiconductor devices, e.g., laser diodes, and are used as input units in conjunction with an automatic data processing machine, or with other machines, e.g., cash registers. They are designed for working in the hand, for placing on a table or for fixing to a machine.
The readers described above are classified in this heading only if presented separately. When combined with other machines (e.g., machines for transcribing data onto data media in coded form and machines for processing such data in coded form) they are classified with those machines provided they are presented with them.
(B) MACHINES FOR TRANSCRIBING DATA ONTO DATA MEDIA
IN CODED FORM
This group includes :
(1) Machines for transferring coded information from one medium to another. These machines can be used either to transfer coded information from one type of data medium to a different type or to transfer it to another medium of the same type. The latter category includes reproducing machines which are used to reproduce all or part of the data on a master tape, magnetic or optical discs (e.g., DVD, CD-ROM) by making a new tape or disc.
(2) Machines for introducing fixed programs into integrated circuits (programmers). These machines are designed to transfer, in coded form, the data contained in the internal memory of the programmers onto integrated circuits. The programmers “burn” the information onto one or more integrated circuits following various techniques suitable for the type of programmable integrated circuit used.
Some programmers have an additional feature (emulator) which allows the user to picture or emulate the result of the programming before actually committing the program to the integrated circuit.
PARTS AND ACCESSORIES
Subject to the general provisions regarding the classification of parts (see the General Explanatory Note to Section XVI), parts and accessories of the machines of this heading are classified in heading 84.73.
This heading also excludes :
(a) Power supply units (heading 85.04).
(b) Modulator demodulator apparatus (modems), which modulate, in transmittable form over a telephone network, information obtained from an automatic data processing machine, and reconvert it into digital form (heading 85.17).
(c) Electronic integrated circuits (heading 85.42).
(d) Flight simulators (e.g., heading 88.05).

Subheading 8471.90
This subheading covers, inter alia, optical disc filing systems which usually include keyboards, displays, optical disc drive units, scanners and printers. These systems may include an automatic data processing machine as the controller or they may be configured such that they are accessible or controllable by an automatic data processing machine. These systems generally perform the following functions :
recording the image by electronic scanning
filing
retrieval
display
printing on ordinary paper."
70,8472,"84.72 Other office machines (for example, hectograph or stencil duplicating machines, addressing machines, automatic banknote dispensers, coin-sorting machines, coin-counting or wrapping machines, pencil-sharpening machines, perforating or stapling machines).
8472.10 Duplicating machines
8472.30 Machines for sorting or folding mail or for inserting mail in envelopes or bands, machines for opening, closing or sealing mail and machines for affixing or cancelling postage stamps
8472.90 Other
This heading covers all office machines not covered by the preceding two headings or more specifically by any other heading of the Nomenclature.
The term “office machines” is to be taken in a wide general sense to include all machines used in offices, shops, factories, workshops, schools, railway stations, hotels, etc., for doing “office work” (i.e., work concerning the writing, recording, sorting, filing, etc., of correspondence, documents, forms, records, accounts, etc.).
Office machines are classified here only if they have a base for fixing or for placing on a table, desk, etc. The heading does not cover the hand tools, not having such a base, of Chapter 82.
The machines of this heading may be hand operated, mechanically operated or electrically operated (including electro magnetic relay or electronic operated machines).
The heading includes, inter alia :
(1) Duplicating machines of the hectograph type (e.g., gelatin or spirit duplicators), and stencil duplicating machines which operate with waxed paper stencils previously cut by a stylus or on a typewriter. The heading includes small presses designed for use with hectographic apparatus.
But it excludes small printing machines (e.g., letterpress, lithographic or offset printing machines) even if intended for office use, and duplicators using embossed plastic or metal sheets (including such machines which can also operate with stencils), and photocopying or thermocopying apparatus (heading 84.43), and microfilm apparatus (Chapter 90).
(2) Addressing machines. These rapidly print addresses on invoices, letters, envelopes, etc.; they usually operate by means of a series of small card or metal stencils or embossed metal plates. The heading also covers special machines used for cutting the stencils or embossing the metal plates, and machines for selecting certain out of a number of address plates or stencils.
(3) Ticket-issuing machines (other than those incorporating a calculating device (heading 84.70) and coin-operated machines (heading 84.76)). This heading includes small portable machines for punched tickets, or which issue and print the ticket from a roll of paper (e.g., as used by bus or tram conductors); it also covers machines for date stamping tickets.
(4) Coin-sorting or coin-counting machines (including banknote counting and paying-out machines). This heading covers such machines whether or not they are fitted with a device for wrapping the coins or banknotes, or in some cases for printing the amount on the wrapping.
Coin-counting machines operating by weighing fall in heading 84.23 or heading 90.16.
(5) Automatic banknote dispensers, operating in conjunction with an automatic data processing machine, whether on line or off line.
(6) Automatic teller machines, with which customers deposit, draw and transfer money and see the balances of their accounts without direct contact with bank personnel.
(7) Pencil-sharpening machines including hand-operated machines.
The heading excludes non mechanical pencil sharpeners; these fall in heading 82.14 or, if they have the character of toys, in Chapter 95.
(8) Punching machines used for punching holes in paper cards or documents (e.g., for loose leaf filing purposes or for simple indexing or sorting).
The heading excludes machines for perforating lines of small holes (as in sheets of postage stamps) (heading 84.41).
(9) Machines for perforating paper bands so that they can be used in automatic typewriting machines.
(10) Perforated band operated machines which do not themselves contain any typewriting mechanism, but constitute separate units used in conjunction with ordinary typewriters for automatic typing. Certain of these machines can select parts from the perforated band as required for a particular letter or document.
(11) Stapling machines (used to fix documents together with a staple) and de-stapling machines.
But the heading excludes :
(a) Stapling pistols (heading 82.05).
(b) Stapling machines of a kind used in bookbinding (heading 84.40).
(c) Stapling machines of a kind used in cardboard box manufacture (heading 84.41).
(12) Letter folding machines, sometimes combined with a device for inserting the letter in an envelope or wrapping it with a paper band.
(13) Letter opening machines and letter closing or sealing machines.
(14) Stamp cancelling machines.
(15) Letter sorting machines used in post offices, including those consisting essentially of groups of coding desks, pre sorting channel systems, intermediate sorters and final sorters, the whole being controlled by an automatic data processing machine and constituting a functional unit within the meaning of Note 4 to Section XVI (see also the General Explanatory Note to Section XVI).
(16) Machines for delivering wrapping paper or gummed paper.
(17) Machines for moistening gummed paper or stamps (including the simple roller type).
(18) Paper shredders of a kind used in offices for destroying confidential documents.
(19) Cheque-writing machines; these are usually small machines specially designed for the purpose. In addition to typing letter by letter, they can often type a whole word or group of words simultaneously (e.g., when inserting, in words, a sum of money). They usually employ special indelible and penetrating inks, and sometimes also perforations or embossing.
(20) Cheque-signing machines; these automatically write in the signature on cheques in an indelible fashion, and usually also reproduce an elaborate background difficult to copy.
(21) Automatic change dispensers used in conjunction with cash registers for automatic dispensing of change to the customer.
(22) Stand-alone machines of a kind used in offices for sorting and collating documents and printed matter.
(23) Typewriters (other than printers of heading 84.43). They are, in general, characterised by a hand-operated keyboard, the keys of which when depressed cause the corresponding characters to be printed directly onto the paper. In some cases they operate by a series of levers and hammers, the character being engraved in relief on the faces of the hammers; in other cases the characters are carried on a ball, a cylinder, a daisy wheel or on cylindrical elements (shuttles) which present the required character to the paper on which it then prints. The text is produced letter by letter, though in exceptional cases combinations of letters (e.g., standards, words or abbreviations) may be used.
Typewriters are classified here whatever the characters used (e.g., normal letters and figures, stenotype symbols, music symbols or Braille characters). Machines for writing in code or for de-coding, operating in the same manner as normal typewriters, are also covered by the heading.
Electric typewriters, whether operated by electric motors, by electro-magnetic relays or, in the case of certain automatic typewriters, with electronic devices, are also classified in this heading.
The heading also covers :
(i) Automatic typewriters. These include :
(a) Machines in which a previously perforated paper band is run through the machines, thus causing it to type a stock paragraph or a complete stock letter.
(b) Machines with a memory of limited capacity which are able, using additional functional keys, to memorise, correct and retype texts automatically.
(c) Keyboardless machines (printers) which print character by character using interchangeable typewheels. These machines are designed to be connected, by means of an appropriate interface, to other typewriters, word-processing machines, automatic data processing machines, etc. Subject to Note 6 (B) to this Chapter, the printers which satisfy the conditions of Note 6 (D) (i) to this Chapter are to be classified as printers of heading 84.43.
(ii) Machines for typing identifying characters (and sometimes also branding with heated characters) on to insulated tubing for electrical wiring.
(iii) Typewriters, not incorporating any calculating device but specially designed for accounting purposes (e.g., for typing on specially prepared forms such as invoices, loose leaf ledgers, day books or filing cards).
(iv) Typewriters incorporating a device for transmitting the figures being typed to a separate calculating machine, or incorporating a counting device for use in speed tests.
(24) Word-processing machines. These comprise, in addition to a keyboard, one or more large-capacity memories (e.g., disc, minidisc or cassette), a visual display unit and a printer. The various components may be housed in a single unit or be in separate units connected by cables. Word-processing machines may be fitted with interfaces permitting, for example, relay to other word-processing machines, to phototype-setting equipment, to automatic data processing machines, or to telecommunications systems. Their ability to correct or compose text is greater than that of automatic typewriters. Their ability to perform arithmetical operations does not compare with that of automatic data processing machines (as defined in Note 6 to this Chapter) and thus they do not lose the character of word-processing machines. They are different from automatic data processing machines of heading 84.71 in that, in particular, they cannot take a logical decision during processing to modify the execution of a program (see Note 6 to this Chapter).
The machines referred to in Items (19) and (20) above can be also used for filling in and signing other documents.

But the heading excludes covers, carrying cases and felt pads; these are classified in their appropriate headings. It also excludes articles of furniture (e.g., cupboards and tables) whether or not specially designed for office use (heading 94.03). However, stands for machines of headings 84.70 to 84.72 not normally usable except with the machines in question, remain in this heading.
The heading also excludes :

This heading covers :
(I) Machinery of a kind used, mainly in the extractive industries, for the treatment (sorting, screening, separating, washing, crushing, grinding, mixing or kneading) of solid mineral products (in general the products of Section V of the Nomenclature) such as earth (including earth colours), clay, stone, ores, mineral fuels, mineral fertilisers, slag cement or concrete.
(II) Machinery for agglomerating, shaping or moulding solid mineral products in powder or paste form (e.g., agglomerating solid mineral fuels; moulding to shape ceramic pastes, unhardened cements, plastering materials, etc., whether or not with an added binder or filler).
(III) Machines for forming foundry moulds of sand.
Many machines of this heading combine two or more of the functions in question (e.g., hydraulic sorting and washing, grinding and sorting, grinding and mixing, mixing and moulding machines).
Certain machines of the kind normally used for the treatment of mineral products can, as a secondary use, also treat non mineral products (e.g., wood or bone); such machines remain in this heading. However, the heading does not extend to machinery specially designed for carrying out similar operations on non mineral materials (e.g., for sorting or screening wood chips; for grinding wood flour; for grinding or mixing chemicals or organic colouring materials; for grinding bone, ivory, etc.; for agglomerating or moulding cork powder).
(I) MACHINES REFERRED TO IN CATEGORY (I) ABOVE
(MACHINES MAINLY FOR THE EXTRACTIVE INDUSTRIES)
This group includes :
(A) Sorting, screening, separating or washing machines for separating the materials, usually according to the size or weight of the lumps or particles, or for washing the materials free of impurities. These machines include :
(1) Roller sorters. These consist of a number of parallel rollers revolving in the same direction in more or less close contact with each other. Each roller has a number of grooves so that, with the adjacent roller, it forms a channel through which the material passing over the rollers can fall if small enough. These channels increase in size along the machine, so that the material falls through the channels and is collected in receptacles below according to the size of the particles.
(2) Screening machines using wire mesh or perforated sheet. The material passes over an inclined screen whose meshes or perforations increase in size towards the lower end. These machines are of two types : in the first type, the wire mesh or perforated sheet is formed into a revolving inclined drum, usually cylindrical or hexagonal (trommels); in the other type, a flat inclined mesh or perforated screen is vibrated or oscillated by the machine.
(3) Rake type sorting machines. The material is sorted by a series of rakes whose teeth are spaced at appropriate distances.
(4) Specialised machines of various types for removing stones, etc., from coal.
(5) Hydraulic washing, separating or concentrating machines. Some simply wash away impurities; others separate out or concentrate the heavier part not held in suspension by the water.
(6) Flotation separating machines, mainly for ore concentration. The crushed ore is mixed with water and certain surface active agents (oil or various chemicals). A film forms on certain of the mineral particles which are then carried to the surface and are removed; in certain cases, the action is accelerated by blowing air into the mixture.
The heading also covers sorting or separating machines incorporating magnetic or electrical devices (e.g., electrostatic separating machines), and machines using electronic or photoelectric detecting devices, for example, sorting equipment for uranium or thorium ore, operating by radioactivity measurement.
The heading does not cover centrifugal sorting machines, i.e., machines in which separation depends entirely on the centrifugal principle that particles of differing specific gravities can be collected at differing distances from the quickly rotating centre (heading 84.21). However, machines in which centrifugal force is used to throw the material against a wire screen remain in this heading.
Conveyor bands used in conjunction with sorting or screening apparatus remain in their own appropriate headings unless forming an integral part of a sorting or screening machine, or unless the conveyor band itself acts as a screening or sorting device (e.g., has perforations for sorting or screening).
(B) Crushing or grinding machines. These include :
(1) Vertical rotary crushers. Essentially, they comprise a vessel in which a cone revolves, sometimes with an eccentric motion; the material is crushed between the cone and the walls of the vessel.
(2) Jaw crushers of various types. The material to be crushed falls between two vertical grooved jaws, one of which is fixed and the other movable.
(3) Drum crushers. The material is lifted to the top of a drum and is broken by falling on to the bottom.

(5) Percussion grinders. The material is thrown violently (e.g., by rapidly rotating arms) against the walls of the machine.
(6) Hammer type crushers.
(7) Ball or rod mills. These consist essentially of a rotating drum containing a number of balls or short rods (e.g., of steel or porcelain). The material is placed in the rotating drum and is crushed or ground by the action of the balls or rods.
(8) Millstone type grinders.
(9) Drop hammer crushers (known as stamp mills); mainly used for crushing ores. A series of cam operated drop hammers, often arranged in graduated stages, break up the material to the required fineness.
(10) Machines for breaking up and kneading lumps of clay prior to further working in the ceramics industry.
(C) Mixing or kneading machines. These consist essentially of a container, equipped with paddles or other stirring devices, in which two or more materials are mixed or kneaded by stirring or agitation. They include :
(1) Concrete or mortar mixers. Concrete mixers permanently mounted on a railway wagon or on a lorry chassis are, however, excluded (heading 86.04 or 87.05).
(2) Machinery for mixing mineral substances (crushed or broken stone, gravel, limestone, etc.) with bitumen, for the preparation of bituminous road surfacing materials. These may take the form, for example, of installations consisting of a group of separate components (feed hopper, dryer, dust extractor, mixer, elevator, etc.) mounted on a common chassis, or of functional units in which the components are simply placed side by side (fixed or transportable asphalt plant).
(3) Ore mixers.
(4) Machines for mixing coal dust, etc., with binding substances in the production of agglomerated fuels.
(5) Machines used in the ceramics industry (e.g., for mixing the clay with colouring materials, or for kneading the ceramic paste).

The heading covers machines for assembling electric or electronic lamps, tubes or valves or flash bulbs, in glass envelopes. It also includes machines for manufacturing or hot working glass or glassware (other than furnaces of heading 84.17 or 85.14).
(I) MACHINES FOR ASSEMBLING ELECTRIC OR
ELECTRONIC LAMPS, TUBES OR VALVES OR
FLASH BULBS, IN GLASS ENVELOPES
This group includes :
(A) Machines for the vacuum sealing of lamp bulbs.
(B) Rotary machines for the automatic assembly of incandescent lamps or wireless valves.
These machines usually include equipment for the heat treatment of glass (e.g., blowpipes or pressing and closing devices for closing the glass envelope), but remain here even if not including such glass working devices.
The heading also includes machinery for assembling electric filament lamps of which the component parts are interconnected by conveyors, and which include equipment for the heat treatment of glass, pumps and lamp testing units (see Note 4 to Section XVI).
The heading does not, however, include machines used solely for making metal parts of components of lamps or valves (e.g., machines for cutting out or deep drawing screens, anodes or supports (heading 84.62), machines for spiralling fine metal wire in the manufacture of electric lamp filaments (heading 84.63), and machines for welding screens or electrodes (heading 84.68 or 85.15)).
(II) MACHINES FOR THE MANUFACTURE OR HOT WORKING
OF GLASS OR GLASSWARE
The glass working machines of this heading are those which work glass (including fused quartz and other fused silica) which has been heated until it becomes soft or liquid. These machines operate mainly by casting, drawing, rolling, spinning, blowing, modelling, moulding, etc. Machines for working glass in the hard state (even if slightly heated to facilitate the operation) are excluded (heading 84.64).
(A) MACHINES FOR THE MANUFACTURE
OF FLAT GLASS SHEETS
This group includes :
(1) Machines for making sheet glass by drawing out flat strips. A roughly formed sheet of glass is picked up by a special device; it is then gripped by rollers and drawn out vertically or horizontally as it passes through an annealing oven. The continuous band thus obtained is cut into sheets (mechanically or by an electrically heated wire).
(2) Machines for the manufacture of floatglass. In the float process, the glass is floating horizontally on a molten media, to manufacture an endless glass ribbon, which later in the process is cut into pieces.
(B) OTHER MACHINES
FOR HOT WORKING GLASS
This group includes :
(1) Bottle-making machines, etc. These range from simple mechanical appliances for gathering and blowing (operated by suction or compressed air and using separate moulds), to automatic continuous feeder machines (with two revolving plates, one with rough-casting moulds, the other with finishing moulds).
(2) Special machines and presses for moulding various glass articles (e.g., paving blocks, tiles, insulators, optical glass blanks and hollow glassware), but excluding presses of general use (heading 84.79).
(3) Machines for drawing, shaping or blowing glass pipes or tubes, and special machinery for drawing fused silica tubes.
(4) Machines for making glass beads, in particular, machines in which cut pieces of tubing are rounded by being rolled in rotating heated drums.
(5) Machines for making glass fibre or filaments. These fall into three main categories :
(i) Machines for making continuous glass yarn for weaving. These consist of a small electric furnace which is charged with glass balls. The bottom of the furnace consists of a draw plate with a hundred or so very fine holes; the filaments are lubricated as they emerge from these holes, and are joined together by a special device to form a single strand. This is wound on a rotating drum which ensures that the filaments are continuously drawn forward.
(ii) Machines for making short fibres. These machines are equipped with an electric furnace and a draw-plate like that mentioned above, but there are also sets of converging compressed air jets on either side. These jets fulfil the dual purpose of drawing out and breaking the filaments. The fibres fall through an oil spray on to a rotating perforated drum; a suction device inside the drum draws the fibres together to form a roving which is wound on to a spool bobbin.
(iii) Special machines for making glass wadding. The molten glass is poured on to a heated rotating disc; it adheres to the corrugations of the disc and is drawn into fibres by centrifugal action.
(6) Machines for bulb-blowing or for making other glass parts of electric light bulbs or tubes, or of electronic valves or tubes, etc. (e.g., base blocks, filament supports, stems).
(7) Machines for making optical fibres and preforms thereof.

8479.89 Other
8479.90 Parts
This heading is restricted to machinery having individual functions, which :
(a) Is not excluded from this Chapter by the operation of any Section or Chapter Note.
and (b) Is not covered more specifically by a heading in any other Chapter of the
Nomenclature.
and (c) Cannot be classified in any other particular heading of this Chapter since :
(i) No other heading covers it by reference to its method of functioning, description or type.
and (ii) No other heading covers it by reference to its use or to the industry in which it is employed.
or (iii) It could fall equally well into two (or more) other such headings (general purpose machines).
The machinery of this heading is distinguished from the parts of machinery, etc., that fall to be classified in accordance with the general provisions concerning parts, by the fact that it has individual functions.
For this purpose the following are to be regarded as having “individual functions” :
(A) Mechanical devices, with or without motors or other driving force, whose function can be performed distinctly from and independently of any other machine or appliance.
Example : Air humidification and dehumidification are individual functions because they can be performed by appliances operating independently of any other machine or appliance.
A separately presented air dehumidifier, even if designed to be mounted on an ozone generator falls, therefore, to be classified in this heading as having an individual function.
(B) Mechanical devices which cannot perform their function unless they are mounted on another machine or appliance, or are incorporated in a more complex entity, provided that this function :
(i) is distinct from that which is performed by the machine or appliance whereon they are to be mounted, or by the entity wherein they are to be incorporated, and
(ii) does not play an integral and inseparable part in the operation of such machine, appliance or entity.
Example : A chain cutter is a device which is mounted on an industrial sewing machine and which automatically cuts the thread so that the machine can run without interruption. This device performs an individual function because it plays no part in the “sewing” function of the machine; as there is no other more specific heading, the chain cutter falls to be classified here.
On the other hand, the function of a carburettor for an internal combustion engine is distinct from that of the engine but it is not an “individual function” as defined above because the operation of the carburettor is inseparable from that of the engine. Separately presented carburettors are therefore to be classified as parts of engines in heading 84.09.
Similarly, mechanical or hydraulic shock absorbers form an integral part of the machine or appliance in which they are to be incorporated. Separately presented shock absorbers therefore fall to be classified as parts of the machines or appliances on which they are to be mounted. (Shock absorbers for vehicles or aircraft fall in Section XVII).
The many and varied machines covered by this heading include inter alia :
(I) MACHINERY OF GENERAL USE
This group includes, for example :
(1) Vats or other receptacles (e.g., vats or tanks for electrolysis), fitted with mechanical devices (agitators, etc.), and which are not identifiable as being for any particular industry and are not heating, cooking, etc., apparatus of heading 84.19. Vats or other receptacles simply fitted with taps, level or pressure gauges or the like are classified according to their constituent material.
(2) Presses, crushers, grinders, mixers, etc., not designed for particular goods or industries.
(3) Volumetric distributing apparatus (e.g., mechanical hopper feeds) and mechanical distributors for continuous presentation of work pieces in the same alignment ready for the working operation, not specialised for any particular industry.
(4) Eyeletting or tubular riveting machines equally suitable for applying the eyelets or rivets to any material such as textiles, paperboard, plastics or leather; and machines equally suitable for joining by stapling the ends of machinery belting of textiles, rubber or other materials.
(5) Vibrator motor consisting of an electric motor with eccentric discs fitted to the protruding ends of the shaft, generating radial vibrations which are transmitted to the apparatus or appliance (chutes, bins, hoppers, conveyors, compacting appliance, etc.) to which the vibrator motor is fixed.
(6) Electro magnetic vibrator, for attachment to conveying, screening, compacting, etc., appliances, consisting of a base plate carrying an electro magnet and two metal rods supporting a mass held in position by two sets of springs at a suitable distance from the electro magnet; the mass is alternatively attracted by the magnet and pulled back by the springs.
(7) Industrial robots for multiple uses. Industrial robots are automatic machines which can be programmed to carry out repeatedly a cycle of movements. By the use of sensors, industrial robots are able to acquire information about the field in which they operate and to analyse the information thus obtained to be able to adapt their pattern of activity to variations in their field of operation.
Industrial robots may consist of an articulated structure comparable to that of the human arm, mounted on a base in a horizontal or vertical position, and having at its extremity a mobile holder for the toolholder (so-called vertical robots). They may also consist of a rectilinear structure often moving on a vertical axis of which the holder forms the terminal part of the operating mechanism often moving on a horizontal axis (horizontal robots). These robots could equally be placed on a beam (beam robots).
The different parts of the structure are activated by electric motors or by means of a hydraulic or pneumatic system.
Industrial robots have many uses; welding, painting, handling, loading and unloading, cutting, assembling, metal trimming, etc. They are replacing humans in tasks performed in a hostile environment (with toxic products, dust, etc.) or with laborious tasks (moving of heavy loads, repetitive tasks of a boring nature). For these varied applications, robots are equipped with a tool holder and tools specifically designed for the accomplishment of the task (pincers, grippers, welding heads, for example).
The heading covers only industrial robots capable of performing a variety of functions simply by using different tools. However, the heading excludes those industrial robots specifically designed to perform a specific function; these industrial robots are classified in the heading covering their function (e.g., heading 84.24, 84.28, 84.86 or 85.15).

The heading also includes wiper blade mountings and mounted wiper blades, provided they are identifiable as for the wiping mechanisms described above; those for use with motor vehicle windscreen wiping mechanisms are excluded (heading 85.12).
(24) Ultrasonic apparatus for cleaning metal parts and miscellaneous other articles; consisting when complete (whether mounted in a common housing or as separate units) of a high frequency generator, one or several transducers and a tank for the articles to be cleaned, presented either complete or without the tank. The heading also covers ultrasonic transducers for such apparatus. Ultrasonic apparatus and transducers of a kind used solely or principally for cleaning semiconductor wafers or flat panel displays are excluded (heading 84.86).
(25) Underwater blowpipes, usually fitted with a special ignition device, and with provision for bringing an additional supply of compressed air or oxygen through a ring shaped outlet round the nozzle, in order to create a cavity in the water so that the flame can burn.
(26) Apparatus for cutting or piercing rock or concrete, using the high temperature produced by burning iron or steel in a jet of oxygen. The apparatus used is usually quite simple, consisting of a heat resisting handle or grip which incorporates a valve and has provision for connecting both to a source of oxygen and to a length of iron or steel tubing. In operation, the oxygen passes through the iron or steel tubing, the end of which, previously brought to red heat, is thus burned away producing a very high temperature sufficient to melt the rock or concrete.
(27) Automatic shoe brushing machines.
(28) Machines for waxing paper cups and containers, etc., by immersion.
(29) Industrial floor polishers.
(30) Evaporative air coolers.
(31) Passenger boarding bridges. These bridges permit passengers and personnel to walk between a terminal building and a parked aircraft, a cruise ship or ferry boat, without having to go outside. The bridges generally consist of a rotunda assembly, two or more rectangular telescopic tunnels, vertical lift columns with wheel bogies, and a cabin located in the front part of the bridges. They include electromechanical or hydraulic devices that are designed for moving the bridges horizontally, vertically and radially (i.e., their telescopic sections, cabin, vertical lift columns, etc.), in order to adjust the bridges to the appropriate position to the particular aircraft’s door, or to the port (entrance) of the cruise ship or ferry-boat. The passenger boarding bridges of the type used at seaports can be, furthermore, equipped with a transitional device installed on their foreside which can be extended into the port (entrance) of the cruise ship or ferry-boat. These bridges themselves do not lift, handle, load or unload anything.
Appliances for cleaning carpets in situ by injecting a liquid cleaning solution into the carpet, the solution then being extracted by suction, and designed for use in establishments (other than domestic premises) such as hotels, motels, hospitals, offices, restaurants and schools are classified in heading 84.51.
The heading also excludes machinery for encapsulation in the assembly of semiconductors (heading 84.86).

In general, the essential function of a mould is to retain the material in a predetermined shape while it sets; some moulds also exert a certain pressure on the material. But the heading excludes stamping dies of heading 82.07 since these shape the material solely by means of a powerful blow or compression (e.g., dies for stamping out sheet metal goods).
(A) MOULDING BOXES FOR METAL FOUNDRY

79,8481,"84.81 Taps, cocks, valves and similar appliances for pipes, boiler shells, tanks, vats or the like, including pressure-reducing valves and thermostatically controlled valves.
8481.10 Pressure-reducing valves
8481.20 Valves for oleohydraulic or pneumatic transmissions
8481.30 Check (nonreturn) valves
8481.40 Safety or relief valves
8481.80 Other appliances
8481.90 Parts
This heading covers taps, cocks, valves and similar appliances, used on or in pipes, tanks, vats or the like to regulate the flow (for supply, discharge, etc.), of fluids (liquid, viscous or gaseous), or, in certain cases, of solids (e.g., sand). The heading includes such devices designed to regulate the pressure or the flow velocity of a liquid or a gas.
The appliances regulate the flow by opening or closing an aperture (e.g., gate, disc, ball, plug, needle or diaphragm). They may be operated by hand (by means of a key, wheel, press button, etc.), or by a motor, solenoid, clock movement, etc., or by an automatic device such as a spring, counterweight, float lever, thermostatic element or pressure capsule.
Taps, valves, etc., incorporating such mechanisms or devices remain classified in this heading. This applies, for example, to a valve equipped with a thermostatic element (double leaf, capsule, bulb, etc.). The heading also covers valves, etc., connected to a thermostatic element by means of, for instance, a capillary tube.
Combinations consisting of a tap, valve, etc. and a thermostat, manostat or any other measuring, checking or automatically controlling instrument or apparatus of heading 90.26 or 90.32 remain in this heading if the instrument or apparatus is mounted or is designed to be mounted directly on the tap, valve, etc., and provided the combined apparatus has the essential character of an article of this heading. If not satisfying these conditions, they are classified in heading 90.26 (e.g., liquid type pressure gauge fitted with a drain cock) or in heading 90.32.
In the case of remote control systems, only the tap, valve, etc., is classified in this heading.
In general, taps, valves, etc., are of base metal or plastics, but those of other materials (other than unhardened vulcanised rubber, ceramics or glass) are also covered by the heading.
Taps, valves, etc., remain classified here even if incorporating other accessory features (e.g., double walls for heating or cooling purposes; short lengths of tubing; short lengths of tube ending in a shower rose; small drinking fountain bowls; locking devices).
Taps, cocks, valves, etc., remain in this heading even if specialized for use on a particular machine or apparatus, or on a vehicle or aircraft. However, certain machinery parts which incorporate a complete valve, or which regulate the flow of a fluid inside a machine although not forming a complete valve in themselves, are classified as parts of the relative machines, for example, inlet or exhaust valves for internal combustion engines (heading 84.09), slide valves for steam engines (heading 84.12), suction or pressure valves for air or other gas compressors (heading 84.14), pulsators for milking machines (heading 84.34) and non automatic greasing nipples (heading 84.87).
The heading includes inter alia :
(1) Pressure reducing valves for reducing the pressure of gases and maintaining that reduced pressure at a fairly constant level by means of a plug or stopper which is generally controlled by a pressure device (diaphragm, bellows, capsule, etc.) damped by an adjustable tension spring. These appliances directly regulate the pressure of gases passing through them; they are mounted, for example, on compressed gas cylinders, on pressure containers, or on feed pipe systems of the appliances which they serve.
The heading also includes pressure reducing valves (sometimes called pressure regulators, pressure reducers or pressure regulator reducers), also mounted at the outlets of pressure containers, of boilers, on connecting feed pipe systems or near the appliances which they serve, to perform the same function on compressed air, steam, water, hydrocarbons or other fluids.
If combined with a pressure gauge, pressure reducing valves fall either in this heading or in heading 90.26 depending on whether or not the combined apparatus retains the essential character of a tap, valve, etc. (see the fourth paragraph of this Explanatory Note).
(2) Valves for oleohydraulic or pneumatic transmissions. (see Subheading Note 3 to this Chapter). These valves, which may be of any type (pressure-reducing type, check type, etc.), are used specifically in the transmission of “fluid power” in a hydraulic or pneumatic system, where the energy source is supplied in the form of pressurised fluids (liquid or gas).
(3) Nonreturn valves (e.g., swing check valves and ball valves).
(4) Safety valves, relief valves, etc., whether or not incorporating a warning whistle.
Bursting discs (thin discs of plastics or metal) are used in certain cases as safety devices instead of valves; they are mounted by means of a special carrier on pipe systems or pressure vessels and burst at a specific pressure. They are classified according to the constituent material (headings 39.26, 71.15, 73.26, 74.19, 75.08, 76.16, etc.).
(5) Manifold valves (e.g., three way valves and “Christmas tree” valves).
(6) Control cocks, blow off cocks and shut off valves, etc., for level gauges.
(7) Radiator drainage taps.
(8) Inner tube valves.
(9) Float controlled valves.
(10) Steam traps in which the water of condensation from a steam conduit collects and which are automatically emptied (e.g., by the operation of a float). The heading also covers steam traps in which the plug or stopper is actuated by a thermostatic element (double leaf or capsule) mounted inside the trap (thermostatically controlled steam traps).
(11) Fire-hydrants (stand pipes), fire cocks, hosepipe nozzles and the like, fitted with cocks or with valves for forming a jet or a spray.
Mechanical sprinkler heads for anti-fire installations, mechanical garden sprinkler heads and the like are excluded (heading 84.24).
(12) Mixing taps and valves, with two or more inlets and a mixing chamber. The heading also covers thermostatically controlled mixing valves incorporating an adjustable tension thermostatic element, which actuates the plugs or stoppers regulating the admission of fluids at different temperatures into the mixing chamber.
(13) Waste holes with plugs (other than simple waste holes with plugs to be inserted by hand, classified according to their constituent material).
(14) Sea cocks and other underwater valves, cocks, etc., for ships.
(15) Lubricating taps with flexible or telescopic tubes for lubricating shafts of steamships, etc.
(16) Soda-water bottle valves.
(17) Pressure spray-can lids for cans to be filled with liquid or gaseous insecticides, disinfectants, etc., under pressure, comprising a metal head fitted with a press button displacing a needle which opens or closes the ejection orifice.

(19) Taps for bottle filling machines, designed to close automatically when the level of the liquid reaches the top of the bottle.
(20) Gas operated beer dispensing units for bar counters, consisting essentially of one or more hand operated cocks fed by the pressure of carbon dioxide piped into the casks of beer.
PARTS
Subject to the general provisions regarding the classification of parts (see the General Explanatory Note to Section XVI), parts of the appliances of this heading are also classified here.
The heading also excludes :
(a) Taps, cocks, valves and similar appliances made of unhardened vulcanised rubber (heading 40.16), ceramics (heading 69.03 or 69.09), or of glass (heading 70.17 or 70.20).

8482.30 Spherical roller bearings
8482.40 Needle roller bearings, including cage and needle roller assemblies
8482.50 Other cylindrical roller bearings, including cage and roller assemblies
8482.80 Other, including combined ball/roller bearings
Parts :
8482.91 Balls, needles and rollers
8482.99 Other
This heading covers all ball, roller or needle roller type bearings. They are used in place of smooth metal bearings and enable friction to be considerably reduced. They are generally fitted between the bearing housing and the shaft or axle, and may be designed to give radial support (radial bearings) or to resist thrust (thrust bearings). Certain bearings may be designed for both radial and thrust support.
Normally, bearings consist of two concentric rings (races) enclosing the balls or rollers, and a cage which keeps them in place and ensures that their spacing remains constant.
The bearings classified in this heading include :
(A) Ball bearings, with single or double rows of balls. This group also includes slide mechanisms with bearing balls, for example :
(1) Those consisting of a steel outer ring rigidly locked with a brass inner ring which has six slots arranged lengthwise and in the shape of elongated ellipses enclosing small steel balls.
(2) The restricted-travel type, of steel, comprising a grooved cylinder, a ball cage and a housing.
(3) The free-travelling type, of steel, comprising a segment, a casing enclosing the bearing balls, and a guide rail with a groove of triangular section.
(B) Roller bearings, with single or double rows of rollers of any shape (cylindrical, conical, barrel shaped, etc.).
(C) Needle roller bearings. These differ from ordinary roller bearings in that they are bearings with cylindrical rollers of a uniform diameter not exceeding 5 mm and having a length which is at least three times the diameter. The ends of the rollers may be rounded (see Subheading Note 4 to the Chapter). These rollers are fitted between the two rings of the bearing and in most cases no cage is used.
Owing to the high pressure to which they are exposed, bearings are normally of steel (especially chromium steel), though some for particular uses are of bronze, copper or plastics.
PARTS
The heading also covers parts of ball, roller or needle roller bearings, e.g. :
(1) Polished steel balls (whether for bearings of this heading or not), the maximum and minimum diameters of which do not differ from the nominal diameter by more than 1 % or by more than 0.05 mm whichever is less; balls not conforming to this definition are classified in heading 73.26 (see Chapter Note 7).
(2) Bearing balls of copper, bronze, plastics, etc.
(3) Needles or rollers for bearings, of any shape.
(4) Rings, cages, fixing sleeves, etc.
The heading does not cover machinery parts incorporating ball, roller or needle roller bearings; these are classified in their own appropriate headings, e.g. :
(a) Bearing housings and bearing brackets (heading 84.83).
(b) Bicycle hubs (heading 87.14)."
81,8483,"84.83 Transmission shafts (including cam shafts and crank shafts) and cranks; bearing housings and plain shaft bearings; gears and gearing; ball or roller screws; gear boxes and other speed changers, including torque converters; flywheels and pulleys, including pulley blocks; clutches and shaft couplings (including universal joints).
8483.10 Transmission shafts (including cam shafts and crank shafts) and cranks
8483.20 Bearing housings, incorporating ball or roller bearings
8483.30 Bearing housings, not incorporating ball or roller bearings; plain shaft bearings
8483.40 Gears and gearing, other than toothed wheels, chain sprockets and other transmission elements presented separately; ball or roller screws; gear boxes and other speed changers, including torque converters
8483.50 Flywheels and pulleys, including pulley blocks
8483.60 Clutches and shaft couplings (including universal joints)
8483.90 Toothed wheels, chain sprockets and other transmission elements presented separately; parts.
The goods covered by this heading are mainly :
(i) Certain mechanical parts which are used in the transmission of power from an external power unit to one or more machines.
(ii) Certain internal parts of a machine, used to transmit power to the various parts of the same machine.
(A) TRANSMISSION SHAFTS
(INCLUDING CAM SHAFTS AND CRANK SHAFTS) AND CRANKS
These usually transmit a rotary motive power. They include :
(1) Main shafts or driving shafts driven directly by the motor.
(2) Counter shafts, for coupling to the main shaft by belts and pulleys or by cogs, etc.; they are used to take the drive from the main shaft to a number of machines, or to different parts of a machine.
(3) Articulated shafts, consisting of two or more shafts connected by ball and socket joints, etc.
(4) Flexible shafts which transmit the motion of a driving unit to, e.g., hand tools, measuring instruments (revolution counters, speedometers, etc.).
(5) Cranks and crank shafts. These may be either made in one piece or assembled from several parts. They receive a reciprocating motion (e.g., from a piston engine) and convert it into rotary movement, or vice versa.
(6) Cam shafts and eccentric shafts.
The heading does not cover simple axles which do not transmit power but merely support a wheel or other revolving part.
It also excludes :
(a) Bars of iron or steel of uniform cross section (heading 72.14 or 72.15).
(b) Simple lengths of twisted wire for the manufacture of flexible drives, not fitted with coupling attachments (heading 73.12).
(c) Oscillating connecting rods for transmitting motion to cutter bars of lawn mowers or grass cutters (heading 84.33).
(C) BEARING HOUSINGS AND
PLAIN SHAFT BEARINGS
Bearing housings consist of a frame or block designed to house the plain, ball, roller, etc., bearing in which (or, in the case of a thrust bearing, against which) the ends of a shaft or axle turn. They usually consist of two parts which, when fitted together, form a ring to hold the bearing. They may incorporate means of lubricating the bearing.
They also often incorporate a chair, plate, bracket, etc., by which they can be fixed to the machine, or to a wall or other part of a building; but chairs, plates, brackets, etc., not incorporating a bearing housing (nor themselves designed to house a bearing) are classified according to the constituent material (usually heading 73.25 or 73.26).
Bearing housings incorporating ball, roller or needle roller bearings remain classified in this heading; but ball, roller or needle roller bearings presented separately fall in heading 84.82.
On the other hand plain shaft bearings are classified in this heading even if they are presented without housings. They consist of rings of anti friction metal or other material (e.g., sintered metal or plastics). They may be in one piece or in several pieces clamped together, and form a smooth bearing in which a shaft or axle turns.
The heading does not include graphite or other carbon bearings (heading 68.15).
(D) GEARS AND GEARING
INCLUDING FRICTION GEARS AND CHAIN SPROCKETS
The basic gear is the toothed wheel, cylinder, cone, rack or worm, etc. In an assembly of such gears, the teeth of one engage with the teeth of another so that the rotary movement of the first is transmitted to the next, and so on. According to the relative number of teeth in the separate units, the rotary movement may be transmitted at the same rate, or at a faster or slower rate; according to the type of gear and the angle at which it meshes with the next, the direction of transmission may be changed, or a rotary movement converted into a linear movement or vice versa (as with a rack and pinion).
The group covers all types of gears including simple cog wheels, bevel gears, conical gears, helical gears, worms, rack and pinion gears, differential gears, etc., and assemblies of such gears. It also covers toothed and similar wheels for use with transmission chains.
The group also covers friction gears. These are wheels, discs or cylinders, which, when mounted one on the driving shaft and one on the driven shaft, transmit the movement by friction between them. They are usually of cast iron, in certain cases being covered with leather, wood, bonded fibres or other material to increase the friction.
(D) BALL OR ROLLER SCREWS
Ball or roller screws consist of a threaded shaft and a nut with bearing balls or rollers distributed along the path between the threads on its inner surface; these devices enable rotary motion to be converted into linear motion, and vice versa.
(E) GEAR BOXES AND OTHER SPEED CHANGERS,
INCLUDING TORQUE CONVERTERS
These provide a range of speeds which can be varied, either by hand or automatically, according to the requirements of the machine. They include, inter alia :
(1) Gear-boxes consisting of assemblies of gears which can be selected in alternative arrangements; the speed of transmission can thus be varied according to the arrangement of gears set.
(2) Friction disc or friction cone couplings and couplings with chains or driving belts, in which a disc, a cone, a chain or a belt is in contact with a friction wheel whose position, relative to the centre of the disc or the ends of the cone, can be varied automatically (or as required), and so controls the speed of rotation transmitted.
(3) Variable speed fluid couplings, including hydraulic torque converters. Variations are obtained by the rotation of vanes of the driving element in a fluid (generally oil) against fixed or movable vanes of the driven element. Power is transmitted either by pressure (hydrostatic changers) or by flux (hydrodynamic changers or torque converters).
The heading does not cover gear boxes or other variable speed changers combined with a motor; these are classified in the same heading as the motor.
(F) FLYWHEELS
These are relatively large, heavy wheels, usually constructed so that the weight is concentrated near the rim. The inertia of the wheel as it turns tends to resist any change in speed of the motor and so keeps the speed constant. Flywheels may in some cases have a grooved or cogged rim, or be fitted with connecting rods, so that in certain circumstances they can act for the transmission of power (e.g., as a driving pulley or cog wheel).
(G) PULLEYS,
INCLUDING PULLEY BLOCKS
Pulleys consist of wheels, sometimes with a grooved rim, which transmit rotary movement from one to another by means of an endless belt or rope revolving in contact between them. The heading covers simple pulleys, drums (wide pulleys), conical pulleys, stepped pulleys, etc.
The group also covers pulley blocks for hoists, etc., and free pulleys which do not transmit any power themselves but simply act as a guide or turning post for a transmission rope or cable (e.g., idlers and jockey wheels used to regulate the tension of driving belts).
An assembly of two or more pulley blocks (i.e., a hoist) is, however, excluded (heading 84.25).
(H) CLUTCHES
These are used to connect or disconnect the drive at will. They include :
Friction clutches in which rotating discs, rings, cones, etc. with friction surfaces, can be engaged or disengaged; dog (or claw) clutches in which the opposing members have projections and corresponding slots; automatic centrifugal clutches which engage or disengage according to the speed of rotation; compressed air clutches; hydraulic clutches; etc.
Electro magnetic clutches, however, are excluded (heading 85.05).
(IJ) SHAFT COUPLINGS
(INCLUDING UNIVERSAL JOINTS)
These include sleeve couplings, flange couplings, flexible couplings, hydraulic couplings, etc., and universal couplings (such as Cardan joints and Oldham couplings).
PARTS
Subject to the general provisions regarding the classification of parts (see the General Explanatory Note to Section XVI), the heading also covers parts of the goods covered by this heading.
The heading also excludes :
(a) Pieces roughly shaped by forging, of heading 72.07.
(b) Transmission equipment of the kinds described above (gear boxes, transmission shafts, clutches, differentials, etc.), but which are designed for use solely or principally with vehicles or aircraft (Section XVII); it should, however, be noted that this exclusion does not apply to internal parts of vehicle or aircraft engines - these parts remain classified in this heading.
Thus a crank shaft or a cam shaft remains in this heading even if it is specialised for a motor car engine; but motor car transmission (propeller) shafts, gear boxes and differentials fall in heading 87.08.
It should further be noted that transmission equipment of the type described in this heading remains classified here even if it is specially designed for ships.
(c) Parts of clocks or watches (heading 91.14)."
82,8484,"84.84 Gaskets and similar joints of metal sheeting combined with other material or of two or more layers of metal; sets or assortments of gaskets and similar joints, dissimilar in composition, put up in pouches, envelopes or similar packings; mechanical seals.
8484.10 Gaskets and similar joints of metal sheeting combined with other material or of two or more layers of metal
8484.20 - Mechanical seals
8484.90 Other
(A) GASKETS AND SIMILAR JOINTS OF METAL SHEETING
COMBINED WITH OTHER MATERIAL
OR OF TWO OR MORE LAYERS OF METAL
These are composed of :
(i) A core of asbestos (or sometimes felt, cardboard or other non-metallic material) sandwiched between two metal sheets.
or (ii) Asbestos or other non metallic materials cut to shape, and with metal sheeting folded along the outer edges and around the edges of any holes punched in the gasket or joint.
or (iii) Layers or metal foil (of the same metal or of dissimilar metals) pressed together.
They are mainly used in certain motors or pumps, or for certain pipe joints.
But the heading excludes gaskets and joints of asbestos board reinforced with metal wire or metal gauze (heading 68.12), unless forming part of a set or assortment covered by the second part of this heading.
(B) SETS OR ASSORTMENTS
OF GASKETS AND SIMILAR JOINTS
Such sets or assortments of any material (agglomerated cork, leather, rubber, textiles, paperboard, asbestos, etc.) are classified here when put up in pouches, envelopes, boxes, etc., provided that the gaskets or joints are not all of the same material.
To be classified here, the sets and assortments must contain at least two gaskets or joints of different material. Therefore a pouch, envelope, box, etc., containing, for example, five gaskets all made of paperboard, is not covered by the heading but is classified in heading 48.23; but if the set also included a rubber gasket it would fall in this heading.
(C) MECHANICAL SEALS
Mechanical seals (e.g., sliding-ring seals and spring-ring seals) constitute mechanical assemblies which form a leakproof joint between flat, rotating surfaces to prevent high-pressure leakage in the machine or apparatus on which they are mounted, resisting the pressure and stress exerted on them by moving components or due to vibrations, etc.
The structure of these seals is generally fairly complex. They comprise :
(i) fixed parts which, when the seal is placed, become integral with the machine or apparatus; and
(ii) movable parts : rotating elements, spring elements, etc.
It is specifically on account of these movable parts that the articles are called “mechanical seals”.
These seals act as anti-vibration devices, bearings, actual seals and, in some cases, as unions. These seals have numerous applications, including in pumps, compressors, mixers, agitators and turbines; they are produced from a variety of materials and in various configurations.
The heading does not cover :
(a) Gaskets or joints, other than the composite types incorporating metal sheeting or foil, which do not comply with the conditions set out in (B) above; these are generally classified according to their constituent material.
(b) Machinery packing (e.g., of asbestos cord heading 68.12).
(c) Oil seal rings of heading 84.87."

This heading covers machines of a kind used for additive manufacturing (also referred to as 3D printing) which is a process for the formation of physical objects based on a digital model. The machine creates the object, on the basis of a design file provided to the machine, by the successive addition and layering, and consolidation and solidification, of material. The machine uses selective application of an energy source, e.g., lasers, resistors, electron beams or UV light, to produce a 3-dimensional object out of materials such as metals, plastics, rubber, plaster, cement, ceramics, glass, wood, paper or seed cells. Depending on the type of machine and the material used, a wide variety of objects can be created in this fashion, including medical devices, prosthetics, art, firearms, buildings and parts thereof, clothes and parts.
This heading covers various types of additive manufacturing machines, for example :
(1) Binder jetting machines which use powder and a liquid binder to create objects. The powder (e.g., metal, plastics, rubber or glass) is spread in layers and each layer has a liquid binder added to glue the powder together. In this way the layers are hardened and joined to form the object, which is then cleaned and cured.
(2) Stereolithography machines layer liquid materials (e.g., photopolymer resins or plastics). The UV laser scans and hardens the first layer of plastics and then the platform rises, allowing the successive layers of plastics to be hardened.
(3) Material jetting machines layer plastics, such as Polypropylene (PP), High-density polyethylene (HDPE), Polystyrene (PS), Polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA), Polycarbonate (PC), Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene (ABS), High Impact Polystyrene (HIPS) and Environmentally Degradable Plastic (ED). The material drips out of a nozzle and is then hardened by a UV light.
(4) Material extrusion machines heat filaments inside an extrusion nozzle that moves in a vertical and horizontal motion, depositing the melted material which then hardens.
(5) Powder bed fusion machines use laser scans or electron beams to melt powder materials layer by layer in order to form an object.
(6) Additive manufacturing machines that layer sheets (commonly of plastics) and fuse those layers together according to a digital model to produce specific three-dimensional objects. These differ from sheet laminating machines, which bond two or more sheets together to form a composite material.
(7) Directed energy deposition machines, which use electron beams to melt materials as they are being deposited in order to form an object.

This heading covers machines and apparatus of a kind used solely or principally for the manufacture of semiconductor boules or wafers, semiconductor devices, electronic integrated circuits or flat panel displays. However, this heading excludes machines and apparatus for measuring, checking, inspecting, chemical analysis, etc. (Chapter 90).
(A) MACHINES AND APPARATUS FOR THE MANUFACTURE
OF BOULES OR WAFERS
This group covers machines and apparatus for the manufacture of boules or wafers such as :
(1) One-melt furnaces for zone melting and refining of silicon rods, oxidation furnaces for oxidizing the surface of wafers and diffusion furnaces for doping the wafers with impurities.
(2) Crystal growers and pullers for the production of extremely pure monocrystalline semiconductor boules from which wafers can be sliced.
(3) Crystal grinders, which grind the crystal boule to precise diameter required for wafers and to grind the flats on the boule to indicate the conductivity type and resistivity of the crystal.
(4) Wafer slicing saws, which slice wafers from a boule of monocrystalline semiconductor material.
(5) Wafer grinders, lappers and polishers, which prepare the semiconductor wafer for the fabrication process. This involves bringing the wafer within dimensional tolerances. Especially critical is the flatness of its surface.
(6) Chemical mechanical polishers (CMP), which flatten and polish a wafer by combining chemical removal with mechanical buffing.
(B) MACHINES AND APPARATUS FOR THE MANUFACTURE
OF SEMICONDUCTOR DEVICES OR
OF ELECTRONIC INTEGRATED CIRCUITS
This group covers machines and apparatus for the manufacture of semiconductor devices or of electronic integrated circuits such as :
(1) Film formation equipment, which apply or produce various films on the surface of the wafer during the fabrication process. These films serve as conductors, insulators and semiconductors on the finished device. They may include oxides and nitrides of the substrate surface, metals, and epitaxial layers. The processes and equipments listed below are not necessarily limited to the generation of a particular type of film.
(a) Oxidation furnaces, which form a “film” of oxide on the wafer. The oxide is formed by the chemical reaction of the top molecular layers of the wafer with the applied oxygen or steam under heat.
(b) Chemical Vapour Deposition (CVD) equipment, which deposit various types of films which are obtained by combining the appropriate gases in a reactant chamber at elevated temperatures. This constitutes a thermochemical vapor-phase reaction. Operations may take place at atmospheric or low pressure (LPCVD) and may use plasma enhancement (PECVD).
(c) Physical Vapour Deposition (PVD) equipment, which deposit various types of films which are obtained by vaporizing a solid. For example :
(1) Evaporation equipment, in which the film is generated by heating the source material.
(2) Sputtering equipment, in which the film is generated by bombarding the source material (target) with ions.
(d) Molecular Beam Epitaxy (MBE) equipment, which grow epitaxial layers on a heated monocrystalline substrate in an ultrahigh vacuum using beams of molecules. The process is similar to PVD.
(2) Doping equipment, which introduce dopants into the wafer surface in order to modify the conductivity or other characteristics of a semiconductor layer such as :
(a) Thermal diffusion equipment, in which the dopants are introduced into the surface of the wafer by the application of gases under high temperatures.
(b) Ion Implantation, in which the dopants are “driven” into the crystal lattice structure of the surface of the wafer in the form of a beam of accelerated ions.
(c) Annealing furnaces, which repair the crystal lattice structures of the wafer damaged by ion implantation.
(3) Etching and stripping equipment for etching or cleaning surfaces of the wafers such as :
(a) Wet etching equipment, in which chemical etching materials are applied by spraying or immersion. Spray etchers provide more uniform results than bath etchers, since they perform the operation on one wafer at a time.
(b) Dry plasma etching, in which etching materials are presented as gases within a plasma energy field, providing an anisotropic etch profile. Dry-etchers use several different methods for creating gaseous plasma which removes thin film materials from semiconductor wafers.
(c) Ion beam milling equipment, in which ionized gas atoms are accelerated toward the wafer surface. The impact results in the top layer being physically removed from the surface.
(d) Strippers or ashers, using techniques similar to etching this apparatus removes the spent photoresist from the surface of the wafer after it has served its purpose as a “stencil”. This equipment may also remove nitrides, oxides, and polysilicon, with an isotropic etch profile.
(4) Lithography equipment, which transfer the circuit designs to the photoresist-coated surface of the semiconductor wafer such as :
(a) Equipment for coating wafers with photoresist. These include the photoresist spinners which apply liquid photoresist evenly over the surface of the wafer.
(b) Equipment for exposing the photoresist coated wafer with the circuit design (or a part thereof) :
(i) Using a mask or reticle and exposing the photoresist to light (generally ultraviolet) or, in some instances, X-rays :
(a) Contact printers, where the mask or reticle is in contact with the wafer during exposure.
(b) Proximity aligners, which are similar to contact aligners except actual contact does not take place between the mask or reticle and the wafer.
(c) Scanning aligners, which use projection techniques to expose a continuously moving slit across the mask and wafer.
(d) Step and repeat aligners, which use projection techniques to expose the wafer a portion at a time. Exposure can be by reduction from the mask to the wafer or 1:1. Enhancements include the use of an excimer laser.
(ii) Direct write on wafer equipment. These apparatus operate with no mask or reticle. They use an automatic data processing machine-controlled “writing beam” (such as an electron beam (E-beam), ion beam or laser) to “draw” the circuit design directly on the photoresist coated wafer.
(5) Equipment for developing exposed wafers. These include chemical baths similar to those used in photographic laboratory applications.
This heading also covers :
(i) Centrifuges for spin-coating insulating substrate or wafers with photoresist.
(ii) Screen printers for printing insulating substrate with etch-resisting ink.
(iii) Laser scribing machines for dividing wafers into chips (dicing).
(iv) Wafer dicing saws.

This group covers the fabrication of substrates into a flat panel. However, it does not cover the manufacture of glass or the assembly of printed circuit boards or other electronic components onto the flat panel.
This heading covers machines and apparatus for the manufacture of flat panel displays such as :
(1) Apparatus for etching, developing, stripping or cleaning.
(2) Apparatus for projection, drawing or plating circuit patterns.

(b) Encapsulation equipment such as presses for making the plastic casings for chips by pressing plastic material around the chips.
(c) Wire bonders for welding gold wires to the contact points of monolithic integrated circuits by ultrasonic or electrical compression welding.
(d) Wafer bumping which is a process where connections are formed on an entire wafer before dicing.
(3) lifting, handling, loading or unloading of boules, wafers, semiconductor devices, electronic integrated circuits and flat panel displays (e.g., automated material handling machines for transport, handling and storage of semiconductor wafers, wafer cassettes, wafer boxes and other material for semiconductor devices).

This heading covers all non-electrical parts of machinery, other than :
(a) Those specially designed for use solely or principally with a particular machine (including a machine of heading 84.79 or 85.43, of Section XVII, Chapter 90, etc.) and therefore classified in the same heading as that particular machine (or, where a separate heading is provided, in that separate heading).
(b) Parts covered by heading 84.81 to 84.84.
(c) Parts covered more specifically by other headings of the Nomenclature or excluded by Note 1 to Section XVI or Note 1 to Chapter 84, for example, transmission or conveyor belts or belting, of plastics (Chapter 39); transmission or conveyor belts or belting, of vulcanised rubber (heading 40.10), and other parts made of unhardened vulcanised rubber (heading 40.16); parts made of leather or of composition leather (heading 42.05); transmission or conveyor belts or belting, of textile material (heading 59.10), and other machinery parts made of textile material (heading 59.11); parts made of ceramics or of glass (Chapter 69 or 70); machinery parts made wholly of precious or semi precious stones (natural, synthetic or reconstructed) (Chapter 71); screws, chains, springs and other parts of general use as defined in Note 2 to Section XV; brushes (heading 96.03).
In general, therefore, the goods of this heading are such as can be recognised as being parts of machines, but not as parts of any particular machine. Subject to these conditions, the heading includes non-automatic lubricating pots; greasing nipples; hand wheels, levers and hand grips; safety guards and baseplates; and oil seal rings. These rings, which are generally of circular cross-section, have a fairly simple structure (a flexible rubber ring and a metal reinforcement assembled by vulcanisation, for example), characterised by the absence of movable parts. They are used in a large number of machines or apparatus to prevent leaks of oil or gas or to prevent dust, etc., from entering, by sealing the surfaces to be joined.
The heading also covers propellers and paddle-wheels for ships or boats."
